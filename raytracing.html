<P>This page gathers some resources about ray tracing in its various forms. It is not exhaustive, nor exhausting, but rather sources of information that we have found useful.

<P>We wrote a free chapter called <a href="./Real-Time_Rendering_4th-Real-Time_Ray_Tracing.pdf"><B><I>Real-Time Ray Tracing</I></B></a> for <a href="index.html">our book</a>, as events after the manuscript was delivered to the publisher practically demanded it. The <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/refs.html#raytracing">online references page</a> for this chapter provides URLs for references cited.

<a NAME="basics">
<H1 class="subHeader">Basics</H2>
</a>
<a href="#books">Peter Shirley's free books</a> are a fast and free way to dig into the topic and learn by coding; there's even <a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/accelerated-ray-tracing-cuda/">a CUDA</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/biroeniko/raytracer">another CUDA (and OpenMP)</a>) and <a ref="https://github.com/ingowald/RTOW-OptiX">OptiX</a> (and <a href="https://joaovbs96.github.io/optix/2019/01/12/rest-life.html">another OptiX</a>) implementation. 
Other short tutorials can be found at <a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing">Scratchapixel</a>.
Morgan McGuire's <a href="https://graphicscodex.com/">Graphics Codex</a> discusses basic ray casting and other related topics, providing code snippets. There are plenty of more books, some now free, listed in <a href="#books">our books section</a>, with <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Ground-Kevin-Suffern/dp/1568812728?tag=realtimerenderin">Kevin Suffern's book</a> being a slightly-dated but good choice for a more in-depth introductory book focused on the topic.

<P><b>Blogs</b> related to ray tracing: <a href="http://aras-p.info/blog/">Aras's</a>, <a href="http://psgraphics.blogspot.com/">Pete Shirley's</a>, <a href="https://ingowald.blog/">Ingo Wald's</a>, <a href="http://diaryofagraphicsprogrammer.blogspot.com/">Wolfgang Engel's</a>, <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2018/11/16/how-to-data-lookups-via-raytracing/">Alan Wolfe's</a>, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/DirectX/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA</a>. Resources: <a href="https://blog.selfshadow.com/">SIGGRAPH 2018 links</a>, <a href="https://jendrikillner.bitbucket.io/post/">Jendrik Illner's summaries</a>.

<P>For basic ray/object intersection algorithm references, see <a href="intersections.html">our object/object intersection page</a>.

<P>For pure amusement, <a href="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2016-01-12-card/">Andrew Kensler's minimal ray tracer</a> is worth a look. Taking it a step further, <a href="http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/">smallpt</a> provides global illumination in 99 lines.

<P>Once you are past the basics, dig into the literature. Newer papers are usually found in conference proceedings,
such as <a href="https://www.highperformancegraphics.org/2018/program/">High Performance Graphics 2018</a>. These can also serve as a guide to important papers in their areas, as each article begins with a summary of previous work.
Older courses such as <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/raytracingcourse/">this from SIGGRAPH 2013</a> can have information of interest.

<P>Much useful information can be found in blogs
such as <a href="https://pharr.org/matt/blog/">Matt Pharr's</a>, <a href="http://psgraphics.blogspot.com/">Peter Shirley's</a>, as well as pieces such as as Demofox's <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2016/09/21/path-tracing-getting-started-with-diffuse-and-emissive/">Path Tracing – Getting Started With Diffuse and Emissive</a> and Anders Lindqvist's <a href="https://www.breakin.se/learn/pathtracing-coherency.html">Pathtracing Coherency</a>.
Aras Pranckevi&#269;ius has a recent <a href="https://aras-p.info/blog/2018/08/01/Pathtracer-15-Pause--Links/">an in-depth series</a> on writing a path tracer, with many more links to resources (which we mostly will not copy here). Matt Petineo also has <a href="https://github.com/TheRealMJP/DXRPathTracer">a path tracer using DXR</a>.

<a NAME="realtime">
<H1 class="subHeader">Real-Time</H2>
</a>
For newer articles, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.jendrikillner.com/tags/weekly/">Jendrik Illner's weekly reports</a>. These often contain links to interactive ray tracing articles.
<P>
With <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/directx/2018/03/19/announcing-microsoft-directx-raytracing/">Microsoft's announcement of the DXR ray tracing API for DirectX</a> in March 2018 at the <I>Games Developers Conference</I></a>, real-time ray tracing has become synonymous with this effort, along with initiatives in Vulkan <a href="http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2018/presentation/s8521-advanced-graphics-extensions-for-vulkan.pdf">such as NVIDIA's</a> (<a href="http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/siggraph/2018/video/sig1826-nuno-subtil-vulkan.html">video here</a>). There are <a href="https://blog.icare3d.org/2018/09/nvidia-turing-vulkanopengl-extensions.html">NVIDIA-specific extensions for Vulkan ray tracing</a> and other features, supported for their Turing architecture. NVIDIA has <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-turing">more information</a> on their developer page. Basic <a href="https://github.com/iOrange/rtxON/tree/Version_2_2">Vulkan ray tracing tutorials</a> are available from one user.

<P>Christoph Schied and many others have released <a href="http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/?fbclid=IwAR3xxHReJSb4TZulhXCEa57wL4pWndJrcNu2sObt0u3ezhlAZhvjRXehkxo">open-source for a fully ray traced</a> version of Quake 2, on Vulkan.

<P>There are other efforts out there, such as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing">Apple's support for ray tracing</a> in their Metal API.

<a NAME="dxr">
<H2 class="subHeader">DXR-Specific</H2>
</a>

<P><a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/ray-tracing-at-gdc/">Our blog entry</a> on DXR contains a large set of links to resources, demos, and related articles that came out around or soon after GDC 2018.

<P>There have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dxr+ray+tracing">many recent videos</a> about DXR effects and demos. SEED's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXo0WdlELJk">Pica Pica</a> demo gives a quick runthrough of some possible effects and their benefits. Digital Foundry's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kQ3l6wN6ns">runthrough of <I>Battlefield V</I></a> has fairly detailed explanations of effects and how they were done with DXR, though one or two things appear incorrect, e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kQ3l6wN6ns&feature=youtu.be&t=669">BVH varying with image resolution</a>. You can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-battlefield-5-rtx-ray-tracing-analysis">an analysis and Q&amp;A here</a>. The <a href="https://youtu.be/1IIiQZw_p_E">Atomic Age explanation</a> is short and sweet, and is particularly good at showing <a href="https://youtu.be/1IIiQZw_p_E?t=123">the limitations of screen-space reflections</a>.

<P>DXR implies GPU hardware dedicated to improving ray tracing performance, such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/raytracing">NVIDIA's RTX</a>. However, for simpler scenes, or for powerful clusters of machines, interactive ray tracing is possible using traditional CPUs or less-specialize GPUs.

<P>The SIGGRAPH 2018 course <I>Introduction to DirectX RayTracing</I> has <a href="http://intro-to-dxr.cwyman.org/">notes and sample code available</a>, as well as much other useful information for getting started with DXR shaders. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/Q1cuuepVNoY">watch the entire course</a> on YouTube. This code has been <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/GettingStartedWithRTXRayTracing">polished and expanded</a>, and blogged about <a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/my-first-ray-tracing-demo/">here</a>. NVIDIA's <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/siggraph/schedule/?session-type=course">Wednesday SIGGRAPH courses</a> have more recorded presentations on real-time ray tracing.

<P>Microsoft provides a set of <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/Samples/Desktop/D3D12Raytracing">D3D12 Raytracing Samples</a>. NVIDIA has tutorials <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/DxrTutorials">on Github</a> for learning about more low-level DXR calls. They also provide <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/raytracing/dxr/DX12-Raytracing-tutorial-Part-1">a standalone tutorial</a>.

<P>The DXR 0.09 Functional Spec is <a href="https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge/blob/master/CommonRaytracing_3/ThirdParty/DXR/doc/D3D12%20Raytracing%20Functional%20Spec.docx">available here</a> and <a href="http://intro-to-dxr.cwyman.org/spec/DXR_FunctionalSpec_v0.09.docx">here</a> without having to sign up to be a developer. Adam Marrs gives <a href="https://github.com/acmarrs/IntroToDXR">a pure DXR tutorial<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/GettingStartedWithRTXRayTracing"> to allow you to get right into the specification.


<P>NVIDIA's <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/falcor">Falcor</a> gives access to DXR ray tracing capabilities. Confetti's <a href="https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge">The Forge</a> supports DXR and much else.

<P>Denoising is critical for real-time DXR performance when using path tracing or other Monte Carlo techniques. <a href="https://cs.dartmouth.edu/~wjarosz/publications/zwicker15star.html">Zwicker et al.</a> give a state of the art report about this area; note that it is from 2015, however, so is not fully up to date.


<a NAME="interactive">
<H2 class="subHeader">Interactive</H2>
</a>

<P>
"Interactive" here means "not DXR-based."

<P>A number of hardware vendors provide free ray tracing software in various forms:
<UL>
<LI>AMD's <a href="https://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/radeon-rays/">Radeon-Rays</a> is an open-source library for ray tracing based on OpenCL.
<LI>Intel's <a href="https://embree.github.io/">Embree</a> provides a collection of kernels designed for efficient ray tracing on CPUs.
<LI>NVIDIA's <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/optix">OptiX</a> SDK focuses on using CUDA for ray tracing. Here's <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/optix/optix_quickstart.htm">a quick-start guide</a>.
</UL>

<P>Enscape <a href="https://gpuopen.com/deferred-path-tracing-enscape/">provides a rundown</a> of their approach to building an interactive hybrid raster/path-tracing system.

<P><a href="https://www.keyshot.com/">KeyShot</a> uses ray tracing for all rendering, even when positioning objects and lights in a scene. Nice <a href="https://www.keyshot.com/gallery/">eye candy</a>, too.

<P>Many <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/results?query=ray">shadertoy demos</a> are based on ray marching or other ray casting techniques run in (often complex) shaders. Mikael Christensen has a <a href="http://blog.hvidtfeldts.net/index.php/2011/08/distance-estimated-3d-fractals-iii-folding-space/">series of articles</a> on modeling surfaces for such rendering.

<P>Historically, the idea of interactive ray tracing has been around for over thirty years, with the introduction of <a href="http://bitsavers.org/pdf/att/pixel_machine/Pixel_Machine_Brochure_1987.pdf">AT&amp;T's Pixel Machine</a>.
There have been other (commercially unsuccessful) efforts over the years, such as <a href="https://www.highperformancegraphics.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/Hot3D/HPG2018_RenderDrive.pdf">ART's RenderDrive</a> from 1998, and <a href="https://97da0272-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/raytracingcourse/Low%20Power%20Raytracing.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7crjeugQ50Uzms9pM9cF4EvxRtB10sisEHmdImLEEvD1LCd6s2dawXfEbAF9H36TJZR8yjYYSRJ5Vz35tWAJx5ex3vm0tqpCe7Tr2RikDkTCPZN76o7ELnkNcchHJC2d5IbLzBMvkrZ-zWI_nUOPG6PDBCumPeJQIY9OiaD7QAIG2oyIXMJGKLHkxfWK0ZTZHkdsvOHMI4bJHR7YfA-KbirnBnLjbaKeSDKFVbJ5qEylbhSQ_uY%3D&attredirects=0">Imagination Technologies' mobile (!) offering</a> from 2013.

<P>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a> has had simple <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/resources/RTNews/demos/overview.htm">interactive ray traced demos</a> since 1995.
Don't bother trying to download and run code, though; better is to <a href="https://aras-p.info/blog/2018/08/03/Random-list-of-Demoscene-Demos/">watch these on YouTube</a>.
With the rise of the GPU, many efforts have become more shader based---see the <a href="https://youtu.be/yqA71-HHY2Q?t=157">SIGGRAPH 2018 session</a> for technical details---so we expect to start seeing DXR-based demoscene entries.

Ray tracing has been used in film production for decades, first seen in <a href="https://www.21cf.com/blog/2017/03/31/blue-sky-studios-academy-award-winning-cgi-studio-renderer-story/">Blue Sky Studio's work</a> which won an Oscar in 1998. Ray tracing is now the standard way CGI effects are rendered by every major studio. Frames are computed on render farms, clusters of
upwards of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/18/disney-big-hero-6/">tens of thousands of processors</a>.

<P>For technical information, the <a href="https://jo.dreggn.org/path-tracing-in-production/">notes from the <I>Path Tracing in Production</I></a> SIGGRAPH course give valuable information about techniques used in film production. Another worthwhile resource is the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3243123&picked=prox">Special Issue On Production Rendering</a> in <I>ACM TOG</I>. NVIDIA's <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/siggraph/schedule/?session-type=course">Tuesday SIGGRAPH courses</a> have more recorded presentations on GPU ray tracing for production.

<P>There are a wide range of offline rendering systems, based on ray and path tracing and other related techniques. Here's a short list:
<UL>
<LI><a href="https://github.com/wjakob/nori">Nori</a> is a simple C++ ray tracer, written for educational purposes.
<LI><a href="http://www.pbrt.org/resources.html">pbrt</a> is well-established, with <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Physically-Based-Rendering-Third-Implementation/dp/0128006455?tag=realtimerenderin">a great book</a> about the code.
<LI><a href="https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/">Mitsuba</a> - a research-oriented ray tracer which is somewhat like pbrt.
<LI><a href="https://github.com/tunabrain/tungsten">Tungsten</a> is often compared with Mitsuba, built on Embree, with a liberal license.
<LI><a href="https://www.ospray.org/">OSPRay</a> is geared towards scientific visualization.
<LI><a href="https://luxcorerender.org/">Lux</a> works with Blender.
<LI><a href="https://appleseedhq.net/">Appleseed</a> works with Maya.
</UL>
Models suitable for these can be found in the <b><a href="portal.html">Models</a></b> listing on our portal page.

<P>There are <a href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=ray+tracer&s=stars&type=Repositories">thousands of other ray tracers</a> on Github alone - let me know which you think is the best.
Back in the day <a href="http://www.povray.org/">POV-Ray</a> was a popular hobbyist ray tracer, and is now over 30 years old; the <a href="https://github.com/POV-Ray/povray">Github repository</a> still shows activity and the code works fine.
This ray tracer
and older resources such as the <a href="http://raytracingnews.com">Ray Tracing News</a> helped lure people such as <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/resources/RTNews/html/rtnv23n1.html#art3">Marcos Fajardo</a> to get into the field.

<P>
There's even a path tracer <a href="https://chunky.llbit.se/">specifically for rendering Minecraft worlds</a> - a few examples <a href="https://chunky.llbit.se/gallery.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/chunky/jpegs/">here</a>.

<p>An affordable Ebook/site that is both a guide to the basics of computer graphics and a practitioner's reference manual. It is continually updated with mini-tutorials, code snippets, algorithm descriptions, and formulae that the author has found of use. Not about ray tracing per se, but includes elements such as <a href="http://graphicscodex.com/Sample2-RayTriangleIntersection.pdf">ray-triangle intersection</a>.
