Minutes of Global Illumination Meeting in Dallas, 8/10/90

meeting organizer & pizza rustler: Greg Ward
secretary: Paul Heckbert

present:
    Jim Arvo, Frederic Asensio, Dan Baum, Chris Buckalew, Jim Bullis, A. T.
    Campbell III, Eric Chen, Michael Cohen, Don Fussell, David George, Ned
    Greene, Eric Haines, Paul Heckbert, Paul Lalonde, Claude Puech, Holly
    Rushmeier, Pete Shirley, Francois Sillion, Doug Turner, Greg Ward

Heckbert: What are the unsolved problems of global illumination that
keep you up at night?

ADAPTIVE SAMPLING OF RADIOSITY

Heckbert: For me, it's adaptive sampling of light directions and
radiosity sample locations on surfaces.

Chen: We should separate shading from geometry.

George: We're doing something like radiosity textures; we have samples
on each surface.

Heckbert: Why hasn't the adaptive substructuring described in Cohen's
1986 CG&A paper been used more?

Baum: it's too slow; the convergence is poor.

George: we're doing something like it.  Our method is cheaper than
Campbell's [siggraph '90].  In our CG&A paper last month we included
some pictures made with adaptive sampling (though the method is not
described there).

DIVIDE AND CONQUER

Sillion: How do you divide the global illumination problem into
smaller, simpler problems?  For example, how do you decompose the
problem for an entire building into room-sized problems?

Baum: see the paper by John Airey (sp?) of UNC at the Snowbird
conference.

ERROR METRICS

Arvo: I'd like to have bounded error, so that I know the difference
between the discrete (radiosity) solution and the continuous solution
is bounded.  I'd like the discrete solution to be within a percentage
of the correct solution for all scenes.

Baum: we did that [referring to Baum-Rushmeier-Winget89?]

Chen: Is anybody making real [physical] models?

Sillion: We're going to build a specular/diffuse box test scene.

Heckbert: It would be nice to have simple test scenes for which we can
construct both analytic and empirical (physical) solutions.  We could
all compare our results against these standards.

George: RMS error is a poor error measure.  If your answer is
consistently darker, or is off by a pixel, this metric will report an
error larger than you want.

Rushmeier: As shown by this morning's paper by Takagi et al, it's
important to define your criteria for success explicitly.

Ward: To create better error metrics you need to take the human visual
response -- what really matters -- into account.  First, you'd register
the two images, then do comparison.

Ward: We need a test suite that includes a matrix of combinations of
various geometry from simple to complex, and various surface types,
including diffuse, specular, and rough specular.

All: where's our pizza?

LIGHT SOURCE DATA

Baum: Does anybody have light source data?

Ward:  I've got some.  Manufacturers often supply such information.
You can get it in IES format.  I've got a converter.

Ward: We should have a common floating point picture format.

CONTROL OF APPEARANCE

Turner: I did animation using both ray tracing and radiosity ["The
Audition", the piece with bulldog, worm, and cannon in the film show]
and found that there was a tradeoff between realism and the control
that you'd want as an animator.  Realistic rendering often means poor
control of visual appearance.

Cohen: It would be nice to point to a pixel or surface point and get a
list of its strongest illuminators.

Heckbert: Greg Ward's ray tracer will do that; you can point with the
mouse and it will print the ray tree, with object names.

PREVIOUS METHODS

Chen: Most solutions are either good locally, or good globally, but not
both.  For instance, the radiosity solution finds the global solution
but assumes that the local behavior (the BRDF) is purely diffuse. On
the other hand, if a more sophisticated local illumination model [such
as Torrance-Sparrow] is used, you can't find a global solution.

Heckbert:  I'm passing around a table of comparisons between the
assumptions made by classic ray tracing and classic radiosity.  Classic
ray tracing assumes, for the diffuse term, that illumination is a sum
of delta functions, and assumes, for the specular term, that
reflectance (BRDF) is a sum of delta functions.  Classic radiosity
assumes that there is no specular component.  I'm also passing around a
rough draft of a table characterizing published global illumination
schemes by the effects they simulate and the data structures they use
to store radiosity values.

DATA/SOFTWARE AVAILABLE

Ward: I've got BRDF data that I can share.

Arvo: I worked on a program that can use arbitrary BRDF data.

Ward: If anybody wants a free ray tracer that does diffuse
interreflection, send me a blank tape.

Anon: and he might even send it back.

Subject: misc for globillum
Status: RO

It was nice to meet you all (sorry-- y'all) in Dallas.  Much thanks to
Greg Ward for the pizza organization (the hardest problem discussed) and to 
Paul Heckbert for setting up the list.

I will try to get the ball rolling...

Francois Sillion mentioned solving partial systems and then combining these
for a full solution.  This seems like a great idea (though I have no ideas
on how to execute it).  I've seen this discussed in two papers:

@inproceedings{kn:xu89,
	Author	= {Hau Xu and Qun-Sheng Peng and You-Dong Liang},
	Title	= {Accelerating Radiosity Method for Complex Scenes},
	Booktitle = {Eurographics '89},
	Year	= 1989,
	Pages = {51-61},
	Annote = {Partions object space for solutions in subdomains. } }
@Article{kn:neum89,
	Author ={Laszlo Neuman and Attila Neumann},
	Title  = {Photosimulation: Interreflection with
                  Arbitrary Reflectance Models and Illumination},
	Journal= {Computer Graphics Forum},
	Year   = 1989,
	Volume = 8,
	Pages  = {21-34} }

I don't really understand the methods in these papers... if anyone here does,
please let me know.


Second, I have some thoughts on standard environments.  There is a class of 
diffuse environments with analytical solutions that are quite artificial but
do allow for complex geometry.  Let every surface in the closed environment
have emitted radiance E and reflectivity R (for a given wavelength).

The outgoing radiance of a surface at point x in direction psi is:

 L_out(x, psi) = E(x, psi) + INT BRDF(x, psi, psi') L_in(x, psi') cos(theta) dw

where the integral is taken over all incoming directions psi (Immel's equation)
Since all surefaces are diffuse with equal characteristics we get:

L_out(x) = E + INT R/pi L_in(x, psi') cos(theta) dw

We know that L_in(x,psi') is L_out(x', psi') where x' is the point seen in 
direction -psi' standing at point x.  Now we can expand the intergal equation:

L_out(x) = E +
           INT R/pi E cos(theta) dw +
           ( INT R/pi E cos(theta) dw ) ** 2 +
           ( INT R/pi E cos(theta) dw ) ** 3 +  ...

Since INT cos(theta)dw = pi we get, for all x:

L_out(x) = E + RE + R**2 E + R**3 E + ... =  E / (1 - R)

The good news is that any closed geometry can be used.  The bad news is
that no interesting light sources can be used (it's a flourescent nightmare).
Still, I think that it is not a bad approximation to INDIRECT lighting.  It
has nothing to say about direct lighting.


Any comments or corrections?

Subject: non-diffuse help
Status: RO

I am trying to finish up a paper that my student wrote about
non-diffuse reflections. There are two papers on this subject
which I can't find in our library. If you have a copy and would
be willing to send it to me could you send me email?

Chen and Wu "An Adapted Solution of Progressive Radiosity and
Ray Tracing Methods for Nondiffuse Environments", Proceedings of
CGI'90, June 26-30,1990.

Shao,P.P., Peng, Q. S. and Liang Y. D., "Formfactors for General
Environments", Proc. Eurographics'88, pp. 499-510.

Also, just by the by, I noticed in the 1989 annual report from
the CMU Robotics institute there is a paper called "An Experiment
in Perfectly Realistic Graphics" by Thibadeau, Hsiung, Thuel,
Chow and Siegel (M. W. not Robert). Generally its a discussion
of their ray tracer. The unique aspect of their work is including
the time element in ray tracing and taking into account relativistic
effects so that you can do stuff like make images of how things
would look if you were travelling towards them at the speed of light.

Subject: Re:  misc for globillum
Status: RO

Hi everyone,

I think Peter has discovered invisibility!  A glowing room with absolutely
no contrast anywhere!  Actually, this seems like a nice starting point to
check that a diffuse simulation is working properly.  It should also
be possible to add any number of perfectly reflective mirrors and still
have the same solution, E/(1-R), for all the diffuse surfaces.

If you are interested, I worked out a solution for one interreflection
on a diffuse sphere sitting on an infinite diffuse plane illuminated by
parallel light from above.  It took all my strength to do the algebra,
so if you want the equations you will have to give me a fax number.

As we consider more sophisticated (and realistic) environments, I think
we will find it very difficult to come up with analytical solutions.
Therefore, I suggest that we use a converged Monte Carlo approximation
as the reference standard.  This method is slow, but is the only one
that guarantees its results (with a statistical uncertainty of course).

I suggest that we create a table of environments with increasing complexity
in geometry and reflectance like so:

		|		Geometry
Reflectance	|-----------------------------------------------
		| Empty room	| Room w/ boxes	| 1000+ polygons
================================================================
Diffuse		| ED		| BD		| CD
----------------------------------------------------------------
Mirror specular | EM		| BM		| CM
----------------------------------------------------------------
Rough specular	| ER		| BR		| CR
----------------------------------------------------------------

We can put one person in charge of selecting the geometries, and
one person in charge of the reflectance models.  I volunteer for
the reflectance models.  (It pays to be first.)  Does anyone want
to create the scenes to go with them?

Subject: standard scenes
Cc: hanrahan@cs.princeton.edu
Status: RO


I think Greg's approach to standard scenes is a good idea.  Before we
go to far, I wonder what geometric primatives should be used... just
polygons?

Also, perhaps the test images should have pretty full spectral solutions,
so that different color models could also be tested.

Finally, I have a nit-picking question for everyone-- we have diffuse
and (specular or mirror or perfect specular or mirror specular) and
in between these we have (rough specular or imperfect specular or specular
or glossy).  What do you think is the preferred terminology?  As far as
I can tell, the Europeans usually use `specular' to mean `not diffuse'.
This would be consistent with the perfect/mirror specular-> rough specular->
diffuse terminology.  Also, does rough specular include reflectance that
is just barely not diffuse?  I don't really think it matters what terms are 
used, as long as we all use the same terms.

Dear global illuminator,

	I've compiled a radiosity bibliography which seems to be pretty
complete.  An early version of this bibliography appeared on comp.graphics some
weeks ago, and I've received some additions since that time.  In a few weeks
I'll put this bibliography on some FTP-able site and will announce it here.
If you want it earlier, write and ask me for a copy (I'm in the 2400 baud modem
boondocks, so am trying to avoid sending it out en masse).

	Before I do so, I want to make sure that the list is as complete as
possible.  So, if you know of any references (including thesis titles) that are
missing from the below, please send them on to me.

	Incidentally, the term "radiosity bibliography" is not quite right.  I
considered "global illumination bibliography", but this is also incorrect (and
too wordy).  Ray tracing is a global illumination technique, and I don't
bother to include most ray tracing references - these references are already
in a separate list compiled by Paul Heckbert and myself (write me for the
latest version).  The references I've included here are primarily concerned
with radiosity per se, but is actually a collection of articles covering
secondary global illumination effects not simulated by classical ray tracing.
For example, Kajiya's "Rendering Equation" paper is included in the list.

	So, here's the list of titles.  I have not added all the Eurographics
workshop '90 articles on radiosity yet (I need to borrow this proceedings from
John Wallace), so don't bother sending these to me.  Note that some of the
titles have been cut short (i.e. whatever didn't fit on one line) - I generated
this list using "grep", "vi", and "sort", so it's nothing fancy.

Hi everyone,

I was talking with Peter Shirley again about the standard models for
comparing simulations.  Here is what Pete wrote to me about my program:

	Radiance's input files made me think that getting standard scenes for
	global illumination may be a pain... "true" radiosity code will need
	polygonal connectivity info, while radiance-like codes will not, etc.
	Also, there doesn't seem to be boiling interest in generating standard
	scenes (just using them!)... I don't think Eric Haines will do such
	public service again.  Also, solid procedural textures seem to be
	getting pretty wide acceptance.  Should your "complex" scene have
	these?  If so, we may need to supply a deterministic random number
	generator.  Perhaps we could start just with that Cornell box.


	Pete

And my response:

	I think we are such a distance from good simulations of general
	scenes that if we start with simple stuff and try to do it
	right, by the time we get somewhere we'll have figured the rest
	of it out.

	Creating the basic models shouldn't be too much trouble.  I'd
	even do it myself but I need some feedback from the other folks
	who would be using it.  A text description of the scene with a
	few coordinate values would probably suffice for the basic
	stuff -- let people enter whatever info. their software needs
	when they run it.

	As far as the complex geometries go, I think that the sky could
	be the limit.  If the simulation doesn't support all the stuff
	that's required, it's all part of the approximation.  I think
	we do need to set an agenda of what people think is interesting
	to simulate.  For example, we will certainly want to model
	architectural spaces, but maybe we don't care about how light
	travels through the ocean.  (Then again, maybe someone does...)

	As I mentioned before, I think the real difficulty is not in
	deciding what to model, but in deciding how to compare
	simulations.

Let's get some chatter from the rest of you folks.  What do you want to
simulate and how should we evaluate the results?

-Greg

In response to what Greg had to say about standards, I think we ought to
begin with really simple test cases. I have been experimenting with the
sort of results I would be able to produce, and I found that to get a solution
within 5% or +-5 (out of 255) at each pixel, it took me nearly 14 hours
to get a 40 x 200 image of a relatively low reflectivity scene of 18
planar surfaces with one diffuse light source. This brings up a couple of
points -- even though my program is really inefficient and I'm just using a
personal Iris, these standards are going to take serious lengths of time.
The second issue is I expect most of you would like to know why I think
I am coming up with an exact solution and why I think I can make any
statements about its accuracy. I think at least a couple of different
people are going to have to produce the same standard images independently
for anyone to have confidence in them. 

Addressing the problem of comparing simulations, I don't think we can come
up with a consensus on how to do that -- but as a group perhaps we could
create a library of environment descriptions and images that people are
willing to contribute so that we could compare our methods against one
another and begin a discussion of what differences appear, and which
difference are important and which aren't.

I just received Greg's mail about his dialogue with Pete Shirley.  Some
things come to mind which I thought I'd pass on:

- Any radiosity databases which get distributed will be much different from
  the SPD (Standard Procedural Databases - sphereflake, the tetra, etc)
  package I made.  SPD tested efficiency, not shading quality, so there's not
  even an ability to set lighting intensity.  Also, the procedural element
  is not as important to radiosity testing (though it wouldn't hurt - we'll
  want more complicated models as time goes on).  There certainly doesn't
  seem to be a point to a procedural Cornell cube (except perhaps meshing).

- Pete brings up connectivity specification.  Is this truly necessary?  As
  someone in the commercial world who is usually handed a bunch of separate
  polygons and told to render them using radiosity techniques, I think of
  connectivity as the programmer's task.  Greg's "Radiance" software certainly
  does not need it, nor does HP's radiosity software (though it helps).  Our
  goal is to give a minimal but complete description of the lighting and
  shading characteristics of an environment.  Researchers could provide
  derived descriptions (or better yet, code to generate these descriptions),
  such as connectivity, meshing, etc, but these would not be a part of the
  scene; rather, they would be useful additional structures.

- So, how can we minimally specify shading?  Seems like someone like Greg Ward
  (hint, hint) or Gary Meyer or Roy Hall would be well-qualified for this
  task.  One thing that should probably be allowed is simplification and
  conversion from the original description.  For example, the database could
  actually provide spectral curves to some resolution (say, sampled every 10
  wavelengths), though in practice most researchers might simply derive an RGB
  triplet from this data.  My question is, how far should a surface's
  description be taken?  Should we give descriptions of two input functions
  like Cook & Torrance's reflectance function, which is a function of
  wavelength and angle of incidence?  Most people won't use it, but for a more
  realistic result you need it.  Researchers should describe their
  simplifications (or extensions) of the shading data.

- Lighting is also an interesting question.  Are point lights "legal" in any
  sense?  There's also very few true "area" lights:  rather, there is some
  volume which is excited and emits photons, which then hit some diffusing
  media (the light bulb surface, or the translucent panel in from of the
  fluorescent lights, etc).  How far do we take this description?

- The question of comparison is certainly interesting.  The least common
  denominator seems to be some rendering at some resolution (as opposed to
  providing RGB/vertex polygons, or somesuch).  This makes for bulky
  comparisons - you certainly don't want to mail them to people not on the
  Internet or without lots of free disk space.  As far as comparison goes,
  taking some measure of the variance between your results and the "true"
  images seems reasonable.

- I see the "true" benchmark images as being a little tricky - when do you
  call it quits?  The problem is that whatever image we agree is "the most
  physically-based" is then the image to beat.  The assumptions made for that
  image can be improved upon by the next implementor, who may then claim his
  image is more realistic.  Comparisons of images is also not a one
  dimensional task: one may use a more realistic shading model, while the
  other uses a superior sampling and filtering technique.

All this makes me feel eminently unqualified to try to come up with some
reasonable test models.  The relatively easy part is the gross geometry - it's
the shading (possibly including microgeometry or texturing) and lighting
specification that's the challenge.  Probably the best thing to do at this
point is to start with something simple (like the Cornell cube) and start
comparing results and see where we diverge (e.g. "Hmmm, so you use a gamma
correction of 2.2, but I use 2.4").  The idiot version of the Cornell cube 
would be (from Goral84):

    left face (red) rho = 1.0, 0.0, 0.0
    right face (blue) rho = 0.0, 0.0, 1.0
    top face rho = 0.84, 0.84, 0.84
    center face rho = 0.84, 0.84, 0.84
    bottom face rho = 0.54, 0.54, 0.54
    back face (light source) rho = 0.8, 0.8, 0.8
	and emissivity = 1.27, 1.27, 1.27

A fairly simple kind of thing:  what would you like expanded upon (or
simplified, if that's possible)?

Fellow global illuminators,

I am impressed by everyone's spirit of cooperation in this 
discussion of standard scenes and standard scene description
formats.  While I appreciate the ambitious goals of some people 
to create a very flexible, extensible format, now does not seem
to be the time for such an effort.  There are several reasons.
First, most people are only working with simple lighting models
(pure diffuse, classical Phong specular/diffuse combination, and 
possibly texture mapping) and geometric primitives (generally only 
polygons).  It would be terrible to waste time adding features no
one would use.  Second, we still have a lot of work to do before
we have generally acceptable solutions that work for these cases.
Thus it would be a long time before we get to move to these 
advanced features.  Finally, we are doing research in rendering,
not user interfaces or programming language design, so spending
much time on this takes away from our real research efforts.

We need to decide what essential elements to put in the description,
and leave it at that for now.  Consider the scene geometry.  For
now, I suggest that our only primitives be planar convex polygons.  
Other geometric items can be added easily later, but this should
meet most people's needs.  We should use the minimal number of polygons
to describe the scene, with no patch/element subdivision specified.
This would allow people doing research in mesh generation, such
as myself, to have unlimited freedom in dividing up the surfaces as
we, and our algorithms, see fit.  Also, this eliminates the need
for polygon connectivity/neighborhood information in the format. 
As far as I can tell, most people are currently using uniform 
subdivision and restricting their scenes to to rectangular polygons.
This type of subdivision is straightforward to implement, so if
people want to experiment with identical meshes, it would be sufficient
to associate an element size with each polygon in the scene.  The
subdivision would be deferred until program execution, so those of
us who want to explore our own meshing schemes could simply ignore
the element size information.

Moving beyond geometry, we have camera descriptions.  Anything 
unambiguous is fine with me.  I think the type of information in
Eric Haines's NFF format (eye position, lookat position, up vector)
is sufficient.

Next we need to come up with a color model.  As much as I hate to
admit it, RGB triples seem to be the most common thing going, so 
we should probably just use these.  Light source colors, as well as
reflection spectra, should be described by three floating point values.
I am unsure whether we should put any limitations on the ranges of
these values.  One one hand, it seems a good idea to limit emittances
to being nonzero and reflectances to being in the range [0,1).  On
the other hand,  I know people who use "negative light" and other such
abstractions, so these people may feel restricted by such a format.

Now, we need to describe light sources.  I believe that we can get
away with a few standard types of emission.  For area light sources, 
we can simply instance a light source in an optional field of the polygon 
descriptions, as shown below.  

light diffuse 100. 100. 100.

I am inclined to stop with area light sources, but if others want
to include point or infinite sources, I can be pursuaded.

Next, we come to reflection.  I think that a very few standard
reflectance models should be used (diffuse and Phong should suffice).  
For colors, either an RGB triple or a texture should be used.  
The reflectance and color could be specified as shown below.

#		       R  G  B
shading diffuse color .9 .9 .9
#	       Kd Ks Exponent	
shading phong  .6 .4 12       texture "mandrill"

There are a few issues that remain.  First is image resolution.
This can be easily specified in the file.  Next is image file format,
both for textures and final images.  We probably need to pick some
existing format (UTAH RLE, GIF, TIFF, ...) and stick with it.

I hope that we can get this standardization effort over as soon
as possible.  I can't wait to start start sharing models.  Then
we can spend our time generating images, timings, analyses, and all
those other things we do in our pursuit of scientific research.

I think A.T.'s desire to keep things simple makes sense (especially leaving
mesh generation up in the air.  I hadn't thought of that). 
Perhaps somebody could donate a default subdivision code?

I don't like the idea of RGB though.  I use a spectral model and converting
from RGB to spectral is a one-to-many mapping.  I'd rather have spectral
descriptions and a simple filter for spectral-to-RGB.

Not as big an issue to me is the lighting model, but I'd prefer a
specification of material constants that is more physically based (index
of refraction and extinction coefficient for metals for example), but
if I am in a minority here I'll adapt.

I also have some rather brute force radiosity code that could generate 
a "correct" result.  It would be great to compare that with other brute
force methods to see if we could have a reliable "real solution".

We could run a feasibility study on that Cornell box.  I can send out mine, 
but the exact dimensions are probably off.  Does anybody have access
to "the real thing"?

pete


PS-- I would LOVE it if we all had a standard image format.  Somebody at the
lunch mentioned a 4-byte format (per pixel, 1 exponent byte) that sounded
sensible.  Anybody have more inf on that?

Subject: some syntax
To: globillum@miro.berkeley.edu
Status: RO


People seem to be in favor of keeping the scene description simple and
forging ahead as soon as possible (I count myself among them).  So, here
are some specific suggestions for syntax.  Maybe we can iterate to
something which is at least tolerable to everyone very quickly so we
can start making pictures and debating about who's pixels are right!

I agree with Eric's point that polygon connectivity is the "programmer's
job", but then it would also be nice to make the information easy to get
at.  For instance we could use the "connection-list" format for polygons,
which would be somewhat compact (if there are a lot of shared vertices),
and would be very simple to extract polygon connectivity information from.

    vertex  1   x  y  z
    vertex  2   x  y  z
    vertex  3   x  y  z
    vertex  4   x  y  z
        .
        .

    polygon  1  2  3   
    polygon  8 9 13 14 90
        .
        .
        .

As for the camera specification, I agree with A.T. that anything unambiguous
is fine, so here is his suggestion (originally from Eric Haines) with a
couple more pieces of information to make it complete. (Eric, how did you
specify the window, etc., or did you use "field of view"?)


    eye position          x y z
    lookat position       x y z
    up vector             x y z
    viewplane distance    d
    viewplane window      left right bottom top
    image resolution      nx ny

Where "viewplane distance" is the distance from "eye position" to the
viewplane, and "viewplane window" specifies the aperture rectangle on
the viewplane. 
    We will want to include comments in these files, for instance to
describe what the scene is, what a certain sub-componenet is, etc.  So,
we should agree on a syntax for comments:


    /*  Allow c-style comments? */

    %  Maybe everything after a "%" is ignored to the end of the line?


There seems to be a call for spectral definitions of colors.  Can someone
toss out a possible syntax for this?  I think that if the definition
is long (i.e. lots of numbers) we will want to define symbolic names for
them, such as


    define spectral color APPLE_RED ......lots of data.......


This is a little farther out, and I'd like to not impede progress toward
a simple and useable scheme, but...  I would like to be able to include the
exact mathematical expressions for the reflectance functions used.  This
will be more relevant to scenes with non-ideal specular & duffuse surfaces,
but it's something to think about.

                                                                  -- Jim

This may be putting the cart somewhat before the horse, but I'd like to 
address the very good point which Holly raised.  How can we have confidence
in someone else's solution?  Reflecting on this for a while, I can only
think of two ways:

    1)  Different algorithms implemented by independent
        researchers produce the same results (+-epsilon)
        when run on the same test scenes.

    2)  The source code for the solver is made public as
        part of the solution.

Presumably the first one is what we'd like to accomplish by defining
a collection of standarized test environments.  But it will take
time for a consensus to emerge (I would guess) and differences to be
explained (as Holly pointed out).
    The second option would be effective in raising confidence in
the solution ONLY if the code can be "verified by inspection".  (I don't
mean verification in any strict sense -- just informally verified.)  If it
consists of 10,000 lines of obscure APL (for instance), having and running
the code will only serve to verify that the same results can be obtained
on different machines.  This is not entirely without merit, but it doesn't
address the bigger issue.  If, on the other hand, the algorithm is easy enough
to discern and verify as being physically correct, though perhaps unbearably
inefficient, then we have something.  It's the same idea as writing a good
proof.  It must be clear or it fails to be convincing, and if it's not
convincing, it fails to be a proof (at least not a good proof).

Now, is it possible to come up with such an algorithmic "proof"?
Well, as Greg Ward has already suggested, Monte Carlo is a possibility.
Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Monte Carlo
as a means of generating solutions for the sandard test scenes.

    Advantages of Monte Carlo

        Simple to write and (potentially) easy to verify by inspection.

        Very amenable to complex environments & BRDFs

        Therefore: source code could be small, easy to
        understand, and usable as a solver for almost any scene.


    Disadvantages of Monte Carlo

        Slow convergence

        Noisy solutions


The advantages make it a good candidate for a verifiable solver, especially
if it uses a strictly "naive" Monte Carlo (i.e. no variance reduction through
stratification, importance sampling, etc. unless these can be done in an
utterly transparent fashion and proven to be unbiased).  But what about the
disadvantages?  Slow convergence isn't such an awful problem for the following
reasons

    1)  The solver could be run to high precision by anyone who has
        lots of spare cycles on a fast machine, perhaps letting it run
        for a week.  (I have an Apollo DN10000 sitting in my office which
        I wouldn't hesitate to use for such a purpose.)

    2)  The solution needn't be high resolution (maybe some will
        disagree with me on this).  If we had "exact" solutions at
        a sparse collection of points (maybe 16x16) on the image
        plane of a standard view, then that would be amenable to
        publishing as a table, which might be the most useful means
        of making the information known and available.

But what about the second problem: noisy solutions.  While it is true that
Monte Carlo will produce answers with statistical variation, that variation
can be made resonably small and can be estimated (via the sample variance)
and supplied as part of the solution.  

Once we've agreed upon a scene description, I volunteer to take a stab at
supplying a "verifiable-by-inspection" Monte Carlo solver and enough
CPU cycles to produce good answers.  Is anyone else interested in this
aspect of the problem (i.e. algorithmic "verifiability")?

                                                                  -- Jim


P.S.  The whole issue of verifiability hinges on having agreed upon the
underlying mathematical model, of course.  I'm assuming that this won't be
much of an issue until we get into more complex things such as arbitrary
BRDFs, texture mapping, etc.  Maybe I'm overly optimistic  :-)

Global Illuminators,

I like a lot of the specific suggestions that have been tossed out 
today.  Jim's proposal of the connection list structure for polygon
vertices sounds fine.  However, there is a point that we must address
very early in the specification process.  Should a scene specification
be completely contained in one file, or should the geometry, emittance,
relectance, and other types of data be in separate files?  I have tried
both approaches, and generally find it much easier to keep everything in
one file.  But I know several formats (DEC's OFF, for instance) which 
keeps things separate.  Jim's example gives me the feeling that he
may use this approach.  What do most people want to use?

My preference for comments within the file is to have a special comment 
character ('%', '#', or '!' seem likely), after which the rest of the 
line is ignored.  This is easy to parse, works well, and allows
easy commenting-out of parts of the database.  With C-style comments,
there are the added problems of commenting out sections already 
containing comments.

Spectral definitions of colors pose an interesting problem.  Basically,
we want to specify the shape of a reflectance curve over a range
of wavelengths.  This can be done with wavelength/reflectance
pairs, together with a specified interpolation function.  Thus
we would have something like

color apple_red
	wavelengths 300 400 500 600 700 800
	reflectance .1  .4  .7  .8  .2  .6
	interpolant linear
color black
	wavelengths 0  800
	reflectance 0  0
	interpolant linear
color weird
	wavelengths 0  100 200 220 225 300 301 500 800
	reflectance .1 .99 .1  .23 .1  .8  .7  .2  .9
	interpolant cubic_spline

To perform our shading calculations, we should specify the wavelengths
of interest.  Then each of colors could be sampled at these wavelengths
using the interpolants, and we will have a consistent number of color 
samples for each surface and light source in the scene.  The specification
of sampling can be done like the following.

sample wavelengths 100 200 700 800  % (nm) 

Of course, we must then have a mapping from the spectral values to
our ultimate RGB result.  I have used a complicated procedure
described in Roy Hall's book, which requires a lot of information
about the destination monitor, among other things.  If we do this, we
must decide on common monitor specifications to compare RGB's directly.
Is this what most people want to do?

I like Jim's and Pete's desires to specify arbitrary reflectance
functions,  but I worry that much effort in that direction could
get out of hand.  In the extreme, we could re-invent RenderMan.
It would be much easier to simply predefine a set of reflectance 
functions, and then add to them as needed.

Please let me know what you think.  I would like to see us develop
something good.

A. T.

Good chatter out there, team!

I'm glad to see so many good suggestions on scene specification.  It's 
an education just hearing what other people have been using.  Let's not
get too bogged down in the details of syntax and so on.  (I vote for 
'#' preceding comments...)  We're all programmers, so as long as the
information is there, I think we can all figure out how to use it. 
It's impossible to avoid evolution in file formats so there's
little use in trying to standardize it beforehand.

Nevertheless, I'd like to throw in my two cents to the discussion on
scene information.  As I see it, there are four basic areas that
demand our attention:  Surface geometry, Surface reflectance,
Light sources and Atmospherics.  I want to talk more generally about
these areas before getting to back a reasonable starting point for a model.

Surface geometry:

I think Jim's suggestion for polygons that refer to a vertex list is an
excellent least common denominator.  An important addition to this
would be an interpolating (or texturing) function to determine the
surface normal.  This becomes very important for specular reflectance
models.  In the long run, I would like to see us use implicit surfaces
and/or parametric specifications.  I haven't got any code for 
tessellating implicit surfaces, but I will gladly make my program for
turning parametric surfaces into normal-interpolated polygons
available (you may have a better one of your own).  Most people would
break functional surfaces into such simpler primitives, while the ambitious
among us attacked the higher order models directly.

Surface reflectance:

General surface reflectance is nasty.  At a point, reflectance is a
function of at least 5 variables:  incoming theta and phi, outgoing
theta and phi, and wavelength.  Reflectance also tends to vary
macroscopically, which is why patterns and textures are relied on
so heavily in computer graphics.  That makes reflectance a function
of 7 or 8 variables, depending on whether you use a surface or a solid
texture.  Here again, I think we should use procedural models, such as
the one suggested by A.T. for spectral reflectance.  (As in the case
of parametric surfaces, the procedures are usually data-driven --
they only serve to interpolate points in a smooth and unambiguous
fashion.)  I have been involved in the development of a device for
measuring the spatial distribution of reflectance (BRDF), and will
make data available to those who want it.

Light sources:

As I mentioned at our lunch meeting, this is a very important area
(or point?) that has been ignored by most simulators.  Namely, we
have all been using diffuse emitters.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  I have
yet to see a light source that even approaches this ideal.  Most
luminaires have highly directional distributions by design, and even
sources that are meant to be diffuse have lop-sided outputs.  Obviously,
this has a huge effect on the light distribution in the scene.  We must
treat light output as dependent on direction, and may even want to
consider its variation over the emitting surface.  Again, I volunteer to
supply some real data (from a luminaire manufacturer) to get people
started in the right direction.

Volumetrics:

We need to consider what happens within volumes.  In general, there
is scattering, absorption and emission (just like surfaces).  I think
many of us can simulate absorption, but we need to consider the other
effects in the long run.  Again, I think interpolated data points is
the way to go in the specification.

Whoa, hold on, wait just a dad-burned minute!

This is all way too complicated to act as a starting point for comparing
simulations.  This is for later, when we figure out better what we're doing.
I just couldn't resist the opportunity to get on my favorite soap box and
blow some bubbles.

Let's start with the basics.  How about an empty rectangular box with
diffuse surfaces and a single diffuse (area) light source?  If someone
would kindly compute a solution, we could all get started.  (Who cares
if it's right -- that's what we want to argue about, isn't it?)  I think
we should give a prize to the first person who offers a simple scene
specification and a solution.  (Pete -- your invisible box counts as
the first dataless simulation.)  Let's use gray surfaces to make things
simple and give the results as point irradiance values (watts/meter^2).
An image is more or less irrelevant with diffuse surfaces anyway.  The
First person to stick their neck out gets to order the pizza next year.
(I'll still run for it.)

Finally, a couple people mentioned standards for image data.  I have
been using a 4-byte float format (red,green,blue,exponent) in my
image files for some years.  This has the advantage of storing the 
full dynamic range of a simulation, which is going to be important for
making comparisons.  Rather than describing my file format in gory
detail, I thought I would just mail out the code for reading and
writing run-length encoded scanlines.  There are also some routines
in there for converting from spectral data to CIE (XYZ) coordinates
and NTSC (RGB).  I have been using NTSC for my image files, but the
format can store triplets from any color system.

As for sharing images over the net, I think we will have to set up
ftp sites to get the data across reliably.  Compression helps, too.

-Greg

P.S.  Sorry this was so long-winded!

Hello again,

What follows are routines for reading and writing images in a reasonably
compact 4-byte per pixel floating point format.  I also have programs 
available for displaying these images under X10 and X11, and converting
to and from some commercial image formats.  Also, the Radiance distribution
includes programs to do cut and paste, filtering, sizing, and pixel math,
among other things.

I need to explain what goes at the top of a correct Radiance file
to make the picture complete.  A few lines of header information,
generally ignored by the software acting on the images, is followed
by a single empty line (ie. "\n\n" marks the end of header).  This
in turn is followed by the image dimensions and orientation.  In a
vain effort to be general, I thought I would allow for any scanline
ordering, though I never use anything other than English scanning
(left to right, top to bottom).

Thus, a typical header might look like this:

rview -vp 0.05 0.5 0.5 -vd 1 0 0 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 100 -vv 100 -x 800 -y 800$
EXPOSURE=3.022424e-01$
pfilt -x 512 -y 512 -1 -r 1 $
$
-Y 512 +X 400$
{IMAGE DATA ...}

(I put in the dollar signs to show the end of each line.)  The header
information contains the commands used to create the files, which I often
need to figure out where "ugly.pic" came from.  The EXPOSURE variable
indicates that the pixel values have been scaled.  The data is sized and
ordered according to the line "-Y 512 +X 400", which means that the
y dimension is 512 pixels, and is the major sort in decreasing order.
Because the x dimension is given second, it is the minor sort and is
increasing.  By convention, the x and y coordinate system starts at
the lower left corner with x horizontal and y vertical.

Your comments are welcome.

Subject: verifiability
Status: RO

I am definitely interested in the verifiability issue Jim discussed.
I compute my "exact" solutions with a naive Monte Carlo solver, and
I don't think we should have a problem agreeing on one even for
complicated bidirectional reflectance functions -- either samples
from the hemisphere could just be weighted by the function, or
for more efficiency a suitable (and verifyable) cdf could be provided
with the reflectance function in the specification. I think that
giving a small array of radiance values for a small number of pixel
centers for one wavelength, accompanied by an array of the sample
variances is a good way to start. This avoids complications of wavelength
sampling and pixel sampling and would let us compare the results of the
interreflection calculations directly. 
Most of my Monte Carlo code is reading in data and doing ray intersections --
the actual algorithm is pretty short. My code is really a mess and not
terribly efficient at doing ray intersections -- I think the best thing to
do would be for someone (Jim?) to alter an existing ray tracer (maybe 
Radiance?)
I wrote up my ideas about a naive Monte Carlo solver (which I called
the "exclusively Monte Carlo method) in my thesis in chapters 4 and 5,
including the treatment of participating media. If anybody has questions
about it I would be willing to send them a copy of the appropriate sections.
Also I would be willing to review the code whoever comes up with and run it
against mine for some simple cases as a check.

I used field of view.

Since we don't seem to be going much beyond the NFF (Neutral File Format) used
in the SPD (Standard Procedural Databases) (got all those acronyms straight?),
it might be a good starting point because it already exists and people have
already written software or translators for it:  at least 10 ray tracers can
use it, including Craig Kolb's public domain RayShade and Mark
VandeWettering's ray tracer.

An even better choice would be Craig Kolb's language definition:  it has many
more primitives defined, has procedural textures, has modeling matrices, has
some primitive area lights, etc.  See his RayShade package on
weedeater.math.yale.edu [130.132.23.17] for info, doc/rayshade.1 is the man
page.

There are a lot of other goodies at weedeater, including the latest,
much improved Utah Raster Toolkit - I highly recommend this format as the best
for 24 bit picture storage and manipulation (and the toolkit has converters
to GIF, TIFF, and many other formats).  Anyone opposed?

How about something simple like:

    spectrum APPLE_RED
    450 0
    460 1.0
    470 1.0
    471 0.1
    510 0

with wavelength and amplitude (0.0 to 1.0), and we linearly interpolate
between the closest two wavelengths to get other samples.  It's up to the
parser to figure out that we're done with data.  Worked fine at
Cornell.

Sounds great, let's use it - fits in just fine with Kolb's format, I think.

--Eric Haines

Attached is some relevant documentation from Kolb's RayShade, which I would
recommend as a good starting point for an input language (let's not reinvent
the wheel):

But first, a sample file:

	/*
	 * generate wood texture on screen
	 */
	maxdepth 3
	eyep 0 0 1
	lookp 0 0 0
	up 0 1 0
	fov 45
	screen 1280 1024
	background 0.078 0.361 0.753
	surface s1  0.15 0.1 0.045  1. 0.75 0.33  0. 0. 0.  0. 0. 0. 0.
	plane s1 0 0 1 0 0 0 texture wood scale 1. 1. 1.
	light 1 point 0 0 1

Here's some of the rayshade.1 document:

eyep x y z
   Specifies the eye's position in space.  The default is
   (0, 20, 0).

lookp x y z
   Specifies the point at which the eye is looking.  The
   default is (0, 0, 0).

up x y z
   Specifies the direction which should be considered "up"
   from the eye's position.  Note that this vector need
   not be perpendicular to the vector between the look
   point and the eye's position.  The default is (0, 0,
   1.).

fov horizontal_field_of_view [vertical_field_of_view]
   The horizontal field of view specifies the angle, in
   degrees, between the left-most and right-most columns
   of pixels present, the vertical field of view specifies
   the angle between the center of the top-most and
   bottom-most row of pixels.  not present, the vertical
   field of view is calculated using the screen resolution
   and the assumption that pixels are square.  The default
   horizontal field-of-view is 45 degrees, while the
   default vertical field-of-view is calculated as
   described above.

screen x_resolution y_resolution
   Specifies the horizontal and vertical resolution of the
   image to be rendered.  This command may be overridden
   through use of the -R option.  The default resolution
   is 512 by 512 pixels.

background red green blue
   Specifies the color that should be assigned to rays
   which do not strike any object in the scene.  The
   default is black (0, 0, 0).

Three types of light sources are supported:  point, extended
(area), and directional.  Point sources are specified by a
location in world space and produce shadows with sharp
edges.  Extended sources are specified by a location and a
radius.  They produce shadows with "fuzzy" edges
(penumbrae), but increase ray tracing time considerably.
Directional sources are specified by a direction.  A maximum
of 10 light sources may be defined.

In the definitions below, brightness specifies the intensity of
the light source.  If a single floating-point number is
given, the light source emits a "white" light of the
indicated normalized intensity.  If three floating-point
numbers are given, they are interpreted as the normalized
red, green and blue components of the light source's color.

Lights are defined as follows:

light brightness point x y z
   Creates a point source located at ( x, y, z ).

light brightness extended x y z radius
   Creates an extended source centered at ( x, y, z ) with
   the indicated radius.  The images produced using
   extended sources are usually superior to those produced
   using point sources, but ray-tracing time is increased
   substantially.  Rather than tracing one shadow ray to a
   light source, multiple rays are traced to various
   points on the extended source.  The extended source is
   approximated by sampling a square grid of light
   sources.  See SAMPLING for more details on the sampling
   of extended light sources.

light brightness directional x y z
   Creates a directional light source whose direction
   vector from each point in world space is defined as (
   x, y, z ).  This vector need not be normalized.

Every primitive object has a surface associated with it.
The surface specifies the color, reflectivity, and
transparency of an object.  A surface may be defined
anywhere in the input file, provided it is defined before it
is used.  Surfaces are defined once, and may be associated
with any number of primitive objects.  A surface definition
is given by:

index [translu stcoef]
surface surf_name ar ag ab dr dg db sr sg sb coef refl transp

Surf_name is the name associated with the surface.  This
name must be unique for each surface.

Ar, ag and ab are used to specify the red, green, and blue
components of the surface's ambient color.  This color is
always applied to a ray striking the surface.

Dr, dg and db specify the diffuse color of the surface.
This color, the brightness component of each light source
whose light strikes the surface, and dot product of the
incident ray and the surface normal at the point of
intersection determine the color which is added to the color
of the incident ray.

Sr, sg and sb are used to specify the specular color of the
surface.  The application of this color is controlled by the
coef parameter, a floating-point number which indicates the
power to which the dot product of the surface's normal
vector at the point of intersection and the vector to each
light source should be raised.  This number is then used to
scale the specular color of the surface, which is then added
to the color of the ray striking the surface.  This model
(Phong lighting) simulates specular reflections of light
sources on the surface of the object.  The larger coef is,
the smaller highlights will be.

[We could add a "Lr, lg and lb" which are used to specify
a light intensity for a surface, so that we can define
area lights - Eric]

Refl is a floating-point number between 0 and 1 which
indicates the reflectivity of the object.  If non-zero, a
ray striking the surface will spawn a reflection ray. The
color assigned to that ray will be scaled by refl and added
to the color of the incident ray.

Transp is a floating-point number between 0 and 1 which
indicates the transparency of the object.  If non-zero, a
ray striking the surface will spawn a ray which is
transmitted through the object.  The resulting color of this
transmitted ray is scaled by transp and added to the color
of the incident ray.  The direction of the transmitted ray
is controlled by the index parameter, which indicates the
index of refraction of the surface.

The optional parameters translu and stcoef may be used to
give a surface a translucent appearance.  Translu is the
translucency of the surface.   If non-zero and a light
source illuminates the side of the surface opposite that
being rendered, diffuse lighting calculations are performed
with respect to the side of the surface facing the light,
and the result is scaled by translu and added to the color
of the incident ray.  Thus, translu accounts for diffuse
transmission of light through the primitive.  Stcoef is
similar to coef, but it applies to the specular transmission
of highlights.  Note that in both cases the index of
refraction of the surface is ignored.  By default, surfaces
have zero translucency.

...

triangle surface x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3
   Creates a triangle with vertices ( x1, y1, z1 ), ( x2,
   y2, z2 ) and ( x3, y3, z3 ).  Vertices should be given
   in a counter-clockwise order as one is looking at the
   'top' face of the triangle.

triangle surface p1x p1y p1z n1x n1y n1z  p2x p2y p2z n2x n2y n2z
		   p3x p3y p3z n3x n3y n3z
   Defines a Phong-shaded triangle.  Here, the first three
   floating-point numbers specify the first vertex, the
   second three specify the normal at that vertex, and so
   on.  Again, vertices should be specified in counter-
   clockwise order. Vertex normals need not be normalized.

poly surface x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3 [x4 y4 z4 ...]
   Creates a polygon with the specified vertices.  The
   vertices should be given in a counter-clockwise order
   as one faces the "top" of the polygon.  The polygon may
   be non-convex, but non-planar polygons will not be
   rendered correctly.  The number of vertices defining a
   polygon is limited only by available memory.

Subject: more stuff about comparisons
Status: RO




Well there has been a lot of discussion on reference geometry
and scene description.  I agree with greg etc. to keep things
simple at first.  I think we can start off with the empty room
and the room/stick model that Holly has (we have already started
doing radiosity/monte carlo comparisons on this model).  As
far as scene description, it would be nice to use an existing format
if possible.  We use Berkeley Unigrafix (with some extensions to
specify normals, materials, etc.).  I think this format would
handle most of the issues (what do you think Paul H.?).  


Since we are talking about using view dependent monte carlo methods as
a reference, we may need to work out a standardized method in mapping
geometric solutions (i.e. radiosity) to image solutions.  It may sound
trivial to just display the radiosity solution with the specified view
parameters, but I'll bet you our hardware gouraud shades different than
your hardware :-)!  Hopefully, the differences in scan-conversion will
be small but it might be nice to characterize it.

I would like to follow up on Jim Arvo's observation:

I imagine we'll always be drawn at some point to compute full resolution
images for visual comparison.  However, there are other ways of comparing
solutions that may be enlightening in different ways and at less cost (which
can be very high, as Holly pointed out).

For example, how about a standard row of pixels from a standard image?  The
values at such a standard row (say 512 pixels long) could be stored in a
table, as suggested by Jim.

To compare an algorithm to the standard you would compute the same row.  A
useful way of presenting the result would be to then plot both the standard
and the new data on a 2D graph of intensity vs.  pixel location.  The results
from a number of algorithms could be plotted on one graph, making the relative
strengths and weaknesses of each fairly clear.  This would be a practical way
of presenting comparisons for publication.

The advantage of computing an entire row rather than a few selected points is
that some algorithms produce characteristic artifacts that are not obvious for
a sparse collection of points, but are quite evident over an ordered set of
closely spaced points.

For example, pixel values for radiosity images are typically computed by
Gouraud interpolation.  The errors introduced by Gouraud interpolation will be
systematic and obvious as you move across a high resolution image row.

This would also be true for noisy results.  If there is noise in a particular
region of the row (e.g., where there is illumination due to a caustic) this
will be immediately evident.

I've plotted a few rows like this in the past and it's been very useful.  It
can also be very enlightening, because it eliminates the image processing step
provided by our brains.  Regions of the image that may have looked like fairly
flat fields are revealed to be slowly varying.  Effects like color bleeding
are more obvious.  Etc.

That's all for now.

If a lot of people want it, I will look into bulk copying.  Otherwise I'll

Let me know if you want anything on this list.

TRENDS IN RADIOSITY FOR IMAGE SYNTHESIS by Wallace (3D Eye)
Invited overview paper.  The most interesting prediction in the 
paper is that as scenes become more complex, it may be worth it
to descretize the environment for each new viewpoint.  This will
lower the N for radiosiy calculations, but they will no longer be
view independent.

INCREMENTAL RAY TRACING by Murakami and Hirota (Fujitsu)
A extension of Parameterized ray tracing that allowed moving some scene
objects in addition to changing material properties.  Used tables of
changed voxels to determine if a ray's interaction with geometry has
changed.  Included implementation on multiple CPUs.  Also includes 
reference to a paper in Japanese by Matsumoto on Octree ray tracing in
1983!

PARAMETRIC SURFACES AND RAY TRACING by Luc Biard (IMAG, France)
Like most parametric patch papers, this one went over my head, but
it seems to be an interesting paper, and includes some implementation results.

THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF GLOBAL ILLUMINATION MODELS by Bouville et al. (France)
Fairly rigorous statement of governing equations of energy transport.  Also
includes some discussion of solving equations for 'subsystems' (rooms) and
then linking these equations.

PHYSICALLY BASED LIGHTING CALCULATIONS FOR CG : A MODERN PERSPECTIVE by me
Review of past rendering techniques with the benefit of hindsight and a
proposed (no pictures!) extension to general BRDF environments.

EFFICIENT RADIOSITY METHODS FOR NON-SEPERABLE REFLECTANCE MODELS by Neumann
and Neumann (Budapest)
A radiosity proposal for BRDFs that aren't expressable as sums of diffuse
and specular.  Their math is too heavy for me, so I can't evaluate the work.

A PROGRESSIVE RAY TRACING BASED RADIOSITY WITH GENERAL REFLECTANCE FUNCTIONS
by Le Saec and Schlick (France)
A proposal for general BRDF radiosity (very similar to what I propose in the
paper above).  Also includes method for interactive display-- display only
non mirrors until viewer stops, then ray trace (UNC style).

A TWO-PASS RADIOSITY METHOS FOR BEZIER PATCHES by Kok et al. (Netherlands)
A radiosity approach with no polygonalization.

THE HEMISPHERE RADIOSITY METHOD : A TALE OF TWO ALGORITHMS by Spencer (OSU)
FF calculation by projecting on: (1) the hemisphere, (2) the base circle
of the hemisphere.  This method is more intuitive than Hemicube and is 
faster IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HW ZBUFFER (because you have one projection instead
of 5 I believe-- isn't compared with one plane zbuffer projection).  Good for
people with sparcstations, crays, etc.

EXPLOITING COHERENCE FOR CLIPPING AND VIEW TRANSFORMATION IN RADIOSITY
ALGORITHMS by Vilaplana and Puyeo (Spain)
Uses coherence properties of hemicubes.  Unclear whether rotation of
hemicubes to reduce aliasing messes things up.

A RAPID HIERARCHICAL RADIOSITY ALG FOR UNOCCLUDED ENVIRONMENTS by Hanrahan and
Salzman (Princeton)
Very interesting paper on using techniques of gravitational systems for
radiosity (rad is similar to gravity because of N^2 interactions and inverse
square falloff in influence.  Is complicated by occlusion and cosine term).
Basic idea (I think) is a generaization of patches and elements.  Assign the
algorithm a goal error bound in radiance.  Let each of K patches be divided
hierarchically into N elements.  When calculating the influence of one patch
on another, the elements might be used for close patches or for far away
patches little work is done.  This is done in an 'intelligent' manner so
that the error bound is respected.  John Wallace comments that when K is large,
then N should be 1 (no subdivision), so there are some domains where this
approach may not be viable.  Still, I expect to see this paper with 
occlusion and some nice pictures one or two years down the road.  The paper
was presented by Salzman abd he said corrected copies of the paper can be 
obtained by contacting him at salzman@princeton.edu.

FAST RADIOSITY BY PARALLELIZATION by Purgathofer and Zeiller (Austria)
Discussion of FF computation in parallel on different 
architectures is discussed.

NEWTON'S COLORS : SIMULATING INTERFERENCE PHENOMINA IN REALISTIC IMAGE
SYNTHESIS by Smits and Meyer (U of Oregon)
Excellent paper on interference effects.  Include first (to my knowledge)
physically modelled oil slick and soap bubble.  Includes discussion
of how to display out-of-gamut colors which come up because of the
pure colors produced by interference.  Presented by Gary Meyer in
GREAT fashion.

LIGHT SOURCES IN A RAY TRACING ENVIRONMENT by Roelens et al. (France)
A method for showing 'cone of light' effect when there is not very
dense participating media in a room (primary scattering only).

METHODS FOR EFFICIENT SAMPLING OF ARBITRARILY DISTRIBUTED VOLUME DENSITIES
by Hass and Sakas (FRG)
Methods of sampling a volume density along a ray.

ray tracing bibliography that Paul & I made, so most basic ray tracing papers
are not included here.  Rather, I've put in only those papers dealing with
extensions to classical ray tracing illumination effects (e.g. caustics).

Thanks to everyone who sent references and corrected mistakes, and please do
keep me posted.

Hi Pete,

Thank you for sending out the summary of the French workshop.  I am interested
in many of the papers you mentioned.  I'm particularly keen to read your paper
and the similar one byLe Saec and Schlick.  I am also interested in the
Princton paper, but will write to salzman for a copy.

If it's not too much trouble, could you xerox and mail me copies of the two
papers?  My address is:

I can handle.  Do you want the Interference paper from UofO?  Not very

I have just returned from Europe and greatly enjoyed the volume of discussion
which has been generated. I will not comment now on what has been said. At
Eurographics, I sat in on a meeting of "global illuminators" not unlike
this group. The issues which were raised were very similar, which is no
surprise. The results of the meeting were to form a working group to
address the same kind of problems we have been discussing. I suggested
there be some kind of cooperation across the ocean and mentioned this
group, which met with interest on their side. I am a bit reluctant to
simply suggest adding a new list of names to this mailing list. There is
something to be said for a small group. (At least you know who is NOT
participating.) On the other hand we should have some contact. They are
a serious group of researchers. Kadi Bouatouch which John Wallace and others
of you may know should be forming the mailing list, etc. I suggested he contact
Paul. If there is some comment on the plusses and minusses of merging efforts,
this may be a good time to say it.

On a similar note, there was also a decision to hold a workshop in
Barcelona next April or May. You have now heard a brief report from the one
held in France this June. Maybe John can comment on the value of it. They
were very pleased by the high level of participation from the States and
would like to have that continue.

I have not worked through the rendering papers presented at EG yet. They
seem to be of varying quality and importance, etc. If people are
interested, I will try to make some comments, or the text available to
those who do not have acess to it.

That's the report from across the ocean, Michael

``A Two-Pass Radiosity Method for Bezier Patches'', by A. Kok, C. Yilmaz, and L. Bierens.
in the proceedings of the Eurographics Workshop on Photosimulation, realism, etc...
hel in Rennes last June.

As far as I understand, sample points are ``uniformly'' distributed on the surfaces
(uniform apparently meaning a uniform subdivision of the control polygons in u-v coord.)
Form factors are then computed but it is unclear what these exactly represent...
(area to point, area to area, ... ??)

This paper sounds like a good 'first step' in the direction of getting rid
of polygons on curved surfaces, but much remains to be done in terms of
finding smart sampling strategies. Also a more rigorous definition of 
energy transfers is needed.

Sure,
In our radiosity/raytracing system Eric Chen and myself render polygons and patches. Polygons get tesselated in the traditional 
manner, patches are partitioned in their natrual <u,v> parameter 
space. It works just fine. In fact I can think of no reason to sample 
curved geometry (ie, tesselate it) simply to create form facter sites.
I'd be interested to hear from others think of this approach.

Subject: radiosity without polygons
Status: RO

Wallace-Elmquist-Haines89 took steps toward radiosity without
polygonization.  They polygonize for the purposes of shooting, storage,
and display, but when they ray trace to compute form factors, they use
the true, curved geometry in their occlusion tests.

And then there are people doing global illumination of both specular
and diffuse scenes using ray tracing:  Kajiya87 and
Ward-Rubinstein-Clear88 simulated radiosity (among other things)
without polygonization.  And in my Siggraph90 paper I discussed global
illumination without polygonization, instead storing the radiosity in a
texture parameterized by each surface's (u,v), as did Arvo86.

Some interesting questions:
  1) What data structures are appropriate for storing radiosity information,
     if not uniform grid polygonizations?
	* Campbell-Fussell90 investigated BSP trees for subdivision/poly.
	* Quadtrees and k-d trees are also a possibility
  2) What about surfaces that are difficult to parameterize, such
	as arbitrary implicit surfaces?
  3) How would these data structures evolve over time in animation?

Subject: Polygonalization for radiosity
Status: RO

More on radiosity without polygonalization:

As Doug Turner points out, the radiosity method does not inherently require
the polygonalization of curved surfaces.  Polygonalization is mostly a result
of the hemi-cube algorithm, as well as the desire to perform the final smooth
shading of radiosity images in hardware z-buffers.

Surface geometry has to be delt with at three levels:

1. Representation of patch geometry (i.e., the geometry of surfaces when
   determining the illumination they provide):

   You have to take into account the geometry of patches when you compute the
   form-factor from them to the surfaces receiving light.  In conventional,
   full-matrix radiosity with the hemi-cube, the form-factors are determined
   by scan converting patches onto a hemi-cube positioned at element vertices
   on the receiving surfaces.  Patches were polygonalized only because of the
   requirement for scan conversion.  Algorithms in which ray casting is used to
   compute form-factors can treat generalized patch geometries without
   polygonalization.

2. Representation of shadowing geometry:

   Again, the hemi-cube algorithm determined occlusion using a z-buffer, so
   polygonalization was a convenient way to represent curved surfaces.  Later
   methods based on ray casting don't have this limitation.

3. Representation of surface shading (i.e., the receiving elements):

   Somehow you need to represent the continuous shading across surfaces.  The
   illumination is computed at discrete points on the surface and then the
   smooth shading is reconstructed using some form of interpolation.

   As Doug Turner described, curved patches can be partioned into elements in
   the u,v parametric space of the surface.  Form-factors can be computed at
   the element vertices using the true surface normal.  Thus the radiosities
   at these points will represent the "correct" shading of the curved surface.

   Reconstruction of the smooth shading across the surfaces has typically been
   performed by passing the elements down to a hardware Gouraud shader, which
   imposes polygonal elements.  If the renderer can handle curved surfaces
   directly, there's no reason to polygonalize.

   The image of three spheres in the 1987 paper "A Two-Pass Solution to the
   Rendering Equation" (Wallace, Cohen and Greenberg) used the method
   described by Doug Turner i.e., subdivide sphere into curved elements.
   Radiosities were computed at the vertices of the elements using the true
   normal to the sphere.  The curved elements were then rendered using ray
   casting, bilinearly interpolating the vertex radiosities in the parametric
   space of the sphere.

I saw the posting that follows on the net some time ago.  Has anyone out there
read it?  If so, please do pass on a summary of it to us all, if you would.
Also, I'd like to get a date of publication so I can add it to the radiosity

Subject: Terminology
Status: RO


          A while ago Pete Shirley brought up the problem of the
          terminology used to describe reflectance (i.e. specular,
          diffuse, etc.) 
          I think this is a subject worth discussing, particularly
          after rereading this years Siggraph article by Takagi,
          Takaoka, Oshima and Ogata. In section 3.3, they reject the
          use of the Cook-Torrance model partly because it models the
          diffuse portion of reflectance as Lambertian. It seems to me
          Lambertian reflectance is unsatisfactory only because Takagi
          et al., in Fig. 3.6, choose to include the reflectance lobe
          near the mirror direction as part of the diffuse portion of
          reflectance, and Cook-Torrance include this lobe in the
          specular portion of reflectance. 

          There are other instances where diffuse versus specular is
          confusing. In one reflectance model I use for infrared
          applications, Sandford/Robertson, diffuse is used for the
          component which is outside of the specular lobe, (which may
          or may not be Lambertian) and specular is used for the
          specular lobe, which may or may not be centered in the
          mirror direction. In a tech report by Nayar, Ikeuchi and
          Kanade that I got from Carnegie Mellon, they propose a three
          component reflectance model -- a diffuse lobe (modelled as
          Lambertian) , a specular lobe (from Torrance-Sparrow or
          Beckmann-Spizzichino) and a specular spike.

          I think it is hopeless to try to get everybody to agree on
          specific definitions of diffuse and specular. Instead I
          would like to see "diffuse" and "specular" retired, and
          terms like Lambertian and mirror-like which are less
          ambiguous used. That leaves the problem with what do we call
          stuff that isn't Lambertian or mirror-like, and how do we
          describe reflectances that approach Lambertian or approach
          mirror-like behavior without long cumbersome explanations. I
          will be happy to use whatever the majority of people in the
          group agree on in stuff I am writing currently. Also, I
          would love to be able to read other people's papers without
          having to prepare a little dictionary to translate their
          terms into my terms. Speaking of terms, do people prefer
          radiance or intensity for energy per unit projected area
          unit time and unit solid angle? In the past I have used
          intensity, since it is used in heat transfer. I would be
          happy to switch to radiance, in fact for infrared stuff that
          is the term I use.
           
          Along the lines of the standard input file format that was
          discussed earlier, obviously I would like to avoid a format
          that forces one to describe reflectance by specifying a
          diffuse reflectance and a specular reflectance.

I will go with Holly on using any terms people agree on-- no matter how
poorly chosen (a bad standard is better than none at all!).  I have a
weak opinion that the term "specular" should not be adopted without 
modification because it is too overloaded.  I prefer "radiance" to
"intensity" because the IES has an ANSI standard defining a consistent
set of terms and units that includes radiance, while the heat transfer
community  has no such standard (that I know of.  Holly?).  The catch
with using radiance is all the Cornell radiosity papers use "intensity",
but I think they all are pretty good about defining their usage in 
each paper, so not that much confusion might develop.  The European graphics
community seems to be using IES units as far as I can tell.  I think
the Physics community is too.  Still, I think that the important thing
is that we all use the same terms.

I think Paul H has made some terminology suggestions about distributed
ray tracing being a misleading term, and everyone is confused by "backward
ray tracing" (you should be ashamed of yourself Jim A :^}).  I'm happy
to go with Paul on using "distribution ray tracing".

Another term that is getting its meaning expanded is "radiosity".  I like
Holly's participating media paper's usage of "zonal method" to mean a 
method that discretizes the environment into constant property zones.
I would use radiosity to mean a zonal method for diffuse surfaces (the
radiosity quantity isn't that meaningful for non-diffuse surfaces). 

I'd be thrilled if we could put some definitions on a sheet and stick to
them so that I could stop having to worry about these things every time
I want to write a paper!

I also prefer the use of "radiance" over "intensity" to describe
energy/time/area/solid_angle.  "Radiant intensity" is used by the IES
for energy/time/solid_angle -- which can be the source of some confusion.

I have always thought of "diffuse" and "Lambertian" as interchangable,
but Holly is right that some people use diffuse differently.  If the
terms are different, then I don't know the difference, and if they are
identical, we can do away with one of them.  I agree that we
should use Lambertian as the more exact term.

I have seen "specular" used many different ways, and I agree
that it is a sloppy term, but I don't think "mirror-like" is a very
good substitute.  To differentiate between mirror reflection and
Lambertian components, I have heard others use the term "off-specular",
but I don't care for this much, either.  We could use "non-Lambertian",
so there would only be "Lambertian" and "non-Lambertian".  The problem
then would be confusion over whether non-Lambertian meant reflection
that doesn't obey Lambert's law, or the part of the BRDF (bidirectional
reflectance distribution function) remaining once the Lambertian
component has been removed.

I vote that we use specular to mean the component of reflection that
doesn't obey Lambert's law, ie. the part of the BRDF remaining after
the Lambertian component is removed.  I think this is a sensible
interpretation of the term as it has been used in the past, and it
is reasonably unambiguous.  I don't really see any good substitute and
I don't think the term should be abandoned.  The only catch is that we
would have to live with specular reflections that are nowhere near the
mirror direction.

I vote also for keeping diffuse around.  The vast majority of people
use it to mean Lambertian, so I don't find its use nearly as distracting
as specular.  If we keep one, we should keep them both.

If everyone wants to abandon diffuse and specular, I will keep them
out of future papers, but I don't know if I will be able to stop muttering
them in my sleep.

Greg's use of specular is consistent with the European Graphics and
Heat Transfer use I think.  How about:

Ideal Specular = Delta function

Perhaps if we can agree on some terminology we should write a short

I agree with Pete's suggestion that we write up and publish whatever
standard terminology we agree upon.  Our current discussion group 
has representatives from most of the types of people doing research
in global illumination: engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists,
and architects.  Therefore anything we agree upon likely will be 
generally useful.  However, we will need to get this information
out to individuals not on our mailing list, in order that they
might consider using our results.

We should definitely try to get the standard in print.  Posting to the 
net or sending out bulk e-mail has some drawbacks.  Many people, 
particularly outside the US, would have no access to the information
electronically.  Also, there are various hassles with maintaing documents
on line.  People would occasionally delete files accidentally, so they 
would either cease to use the standard or need to contact one of us for 
a replacement.

My suggestion is to write up a small paper and submit it to IEEE
Computer Graphics and Applications.  The form should be much like Eric 
Haines's "A Proposal for Standard Graphics Environments" (CG&A, November 1987).
Eric can give us some idea how long the submissions pipeline may take.

I am anxious to see what develops.

I suppose I should throw in my two cents worth. I think we might agree on
three terms:

I.  Ideal diffuse or Lambertian Diffuse (either is acceptable)

II. Ideal Specular

III. General

These can apply to reflectance or transmittance.

E.G., "My bidirectional reflectance model consists of Ideal Diffuse terms,
ideal specular terms and a Phong model for the general reflectance."

On the other issue: Intensity vs. Radiance vs. ???

Intensity is an overloaded term but people know what you are talking about.
Radiance tends to stay more tightly defined but people have a harder time
with it. I will defer any strong opinion on this one.

Since we are talking about issuing a standards proposal, I do have a
strong opinion about "radiance".  I think we should use standard
radiometric terminology (radiance, irradiance, radiant intensity,
etc).

The term "intensity" has too many definitions.  In radiometry, it is
watts per solid angle, in geometrical optics it is watts per wavefront
area, in Sparrow & Cess it is watts per area per solid angle.  The word
is also used informally to express the power of a light source, or just
subjective brightness.  When this word appears in a graphics paper, you
have to stop and look carefully at definitions to see which of these
many possible meanings it might have.

Radiometric units are used in computer vision and illumination
engineering.  Along with photometry and colorimetry, these are the
accepted standards for talking about visible light.  Quite a few
graphics people are already using these units.

The terminology of heat transfer has been used in some formal
discussions of shading models in graphics (thanks to the important work
at Cornell by Torrance, Cook, and others).  But heat transfer is not
exactly the same physics as illumination, and there is different
phenomenology.  Studying heat, one doesn't worry about colorimetry or
apparent brightness or imaging systems.  Studying illumination, one
doesn't worry about black bodies and radiative equilibrium (unless you
set your thermostat to 6000 K).

Subject: Terminology & Standards
Status: RO


The idea of defining a standard terminology for reflectance components
sounds great, and would make both writing and reading papers easier.
However, I want to point out that I believe notations and
terminology should still be carefully explained in all papers (after all, there
will always be someone to use the terms in his/her own way).

We should probably not try and re-invent the wheel, since many people
have tried already to define standards : for example,
"Geometrical Considerations and Nomenclature for Reflectance", by
Nicodemus, Richmond and Hsia, (National Bureau of Standards, now NIST)
and Ginsberg and Limperis, published in 1977,  defines not only
units such as radiance and or radiant exitance, but also attempts 
to standardize the notations for the geometry, and some qualifiers,
such as diffuse (a.k.a. isotropic, lambertian), and specular (or regular,
defined as mirror-like).

I agree very much with Michael Cohen that diffuse and specular should be used
only for the two extreme cases of Lambertian and mirror-like. Also, I think
it is probably a good idea to use radiance, even though I might define
in my papers the two terms to be the same, and then use intensity...

Several people here at Cornell are developing a general reflectance model 
for statistical rough surfaces, and we have been thinking for a while 
about terminology.
We separate the BRDF into three parts, that are not defined purely from
their directional properties, but also have a strong physical meaning :

	- We call specular the mirror-like part of the reflection. Another
	definition, due to Steve Westin, is ``a surface is specular if you
	can comb your hair in it''. This part appears in physical-optics models
	when the coherent component of the average EM field is evaluated,
	and can be shown to decrease exponentialy with surface roughness. (That is
	to say, there is still some significant physical behavior behind the
	delta function).

	- We call "directional diffuse" the part that can be predicted by the
	statistical averaging of the reflected field, or "incoherent term".
	This term may or may not be Lambertian, and may or not be shaped
	as a "specular blob". [By the way, "off-specular" is used to describe
	a directional blob that reaches its maximum in a direction different 
	from the specular direction. It is observed at large incident angles, 
	on rough surfaces, and is modeled by the Cook-Torrance model].

	- What we call the diffuse part, is a Lambertian term, supposedly
	originating from internal scattering (below the surface) and/or
	multiple reflections on the surface.

The "directional diffuse" part of the reflectance, which is the most 
interesting one in many cases, probably deserves a better name, but 
we couldn't think of one... 
It should be noted that in a simple model of reflection by microfacets, such
as Cook-Torrance, the directional diffuse term originates from specular (mirror)
reflection on the micro-facets, but the end result, in our view, is not to be
called specular. 

Finally, If the "Lambertian part of the BRDF" mentioned by Greg is defined as
the minimum value of the BRDF, in our terminology it can be caused 
both by diffuse and directional-diffuse reflection. Therefore, splitting the
reflectance into lambertian, general, and specular components will hide some
of the physics involved.

I apologize for complicating the subject further, but I believe it is
an important question to decide whether the separation of
the reflectance into different parts (which will always be somewhat arbitrary)
should be done on the basis of the directional properties, or on the basis
of the physics of reflection.

I am looking forward to reading any reactions to this message...

Since we are trying to use some discrete names to describe a continuous
function, it is subject to aliasing problems no matter what names we come
up with. Recognizing this makes me feel more comfortable in throwing in my two
cents worth.

I don't think we need to abandon diffuse and specular. Neither should we try
to give them specific meanings, such as specular means directional. 
These terms are very overloaded and we should leave them alone.
They are ambiguious.  But that's precisely what they should be used for--
in the same way when people say something is red. 

I tend to agree with Michael's suggestions that we use ideal diffuse for
Labmbertian and ideal specular for mirror-like. They are informative and
easy for people to relate to. I prefer ideal diffuse to Lambertian diffuse 
because it is less obscure and matches ideal specular well (otherwise, what
would you call ideal specular?). Calling everything else "general" is a
little bit too general but I don't have better suggestions.

I agree with Don, the term intensity is very loaded. We probably should use 
radiance instead.

I think Nicodemus' work has all been absorbed by the IES/ANSI standard, so
it would be nice to just use it.  If you don't have a copy it is ANSI/IES
RP-16-1986 (ISBN 0-87955-022-6).  Here is what it defines (not complete):

   Radiant flux (radiant power)
   Radiant Intensity (not radiance or intensity)
   Radiance
   Radiator (Light source, luminaire)
   Diffusing surfaces and media (perform at least some scattering)
   Lambertian surface
   Complete diffusion (no incident flux can remain in an image forming state)
   Wide-angle diffusion
   Narrow-angle diffusion
   Regular (specular) reflection
   Specular angle
   Diffuse reflection (more general than Lambertian)
   BRDF
   

I would especially like to be able to use the first 4 without definition.
In addition to BRDF, I'd like to add a power oriented measure (for a
Lambertian surface the BRDF is K, and this "other" measure would be
K'cos theta).

A good compromise-- if you use intensity, have one throw away sentence
about radiance (and vice-versa).

A short paper on terminology is an excellent idea.

I've rarely seen the term "diffuse" used in a non-Lambertian sense,
so I've never qualified it with terms such as "ideal diffuse"
or "Lambertian".  If there is a sizeable community that uses "diffuse"
in a broader sense than "Lambertian", however, then we should use a qualifier.
Holly mentioned a few papers with such use of the term "diffuse", but
such definitions are the exception, I believe.

"Specular" is a vaguer term to me, which could mean either sharp or fuzzy
reflection (or transmission).  So here we definitely need qualifiers.
"Ideal specular" is a good term, I think, for a delta function BRDF.
What to call non-ideal specular, and how broadly to define "specular",
are more difficult questions.

In my siggraph paper this year, I wanted "ideal specular" to include
interfaces that are part reflective and part transmissive with
distributions that are delta functions (such as glass), and also
birefractive materials (such as calcite) as well, so I defined "ideal
specular" as reflectance and transmittance that scatters light in a
finite number of directions.  Note that this definition places no
limitations on the direction of the reflected or transmitted rays, so
further qualifiers beyond "ideal" would be needed to be fully
specific.  I defined "specular" as everything that was left after
diffuse was subtracted, and "rough specular" as everything specular
that wasn't "ideal specular".  These last two definitions were more
problematical and I would welcome alternative suggestions.  The above
definition of "ideal specular" maps very cleanly into ray tracing:
ideal specular can be simulated with classic ray tracing, while rough
specular requires distribution ray tracing (since the distributions of
rough specular have positive solid angle).

We need a word which means "reflectance or transmittance".  I've
used the word "interaction" to mean "reflection or transmission",
but never found a satisfactory word for the coefficient of interaction.

I've also groped to find a term for the thing you get when you weld
together a BRDF and a BTDF (bidirectional transmittance distribution
function).  I don't think of the BRDF and BTDF as separate functions,
but as the halves of the whole function.  I find it convenient to wrap
up all surface shading into the function

    BDF(in, out, lambda, u, v)

which is bidirectional (reflectance or transmittance) distribution as a
function of incoming light direction vector "in", outgoing light
direction vector "out", wavelength, and surface parameters u and v,
where "in" and "out" vary over an entire sphere of directions.
Is there a name for this sucker?

 A while ago Ted Himlan at Cornell collected a lot of documents
about standard terminology for radiation and optics. One thing he
turned up was a series on Optical Radiation Measurements, by Venable and
Hsia and NBS (now NIST). In the chapter "Describing Spectrophotometric
Measurements", they refer to a descriptor that indicates the manner
in which radiation emerges from a sample space (i.e. a surface area)
as the "scattering function". We could refer to the combination of
the BRDF and BTDF as BSDF - bidirectional scattering distribution
function.
  I can see that diffuse and specular won't die. I think at best though
we can use diffuse as meaning weakly dependent on direction, and
specular as meaning strongly dependent on direction. I also think
ideal diffuse is easily interchangeable with Lambertian. Ideal specular
is a different problem. Since ideal is synonymous with model or perfect,
I would rather not qualify it further. An alternative I have seen is
"regular".

There is another reflectance/scattering structure I'd like a standard term
for-- the probability density function of where an energy packet will
scatter:

	p(in, out) is probability density with respect to solid angle
of scattering in direction out.

This type of measurement is more natural than BRDF when dealing with power
transport.  It, combined with R(in) would completely describe reflectance
behavior.  (I don't want to use this INSTEAD of BRDF, but in addition).
Is there a standard term for this?  I call it the scattering probability
function.

Specular

	I agree with Paul H. that specular is a fuzzy word.  The term is
pretty overloaded.  For example, for workstation vendors "specular" merely
means highlights from light sources using Phong's distribution function.  In
classical ray tracing the distribution function can get more involved (e.g.
different distributions, Fresnel term, etc), but we still use "specularity" to
mean "shininess" and this usually affects only the highlights from light
sources.

	I use "specular reflection" and "specular transmission" if I'm trying
to be precise.  But if I use "reflection" and "transmission" when talking
about ray tracing, most know I mean the contributions from the ray shot in the
mirror direction and the refracted ray.  If anything, a term like "specular
reflection" usually means to a ray trace researcher only the contribution from
the reflected ray, not from the light sources.  Specular contributions from
light sources are thought of as "highlights", or not thought about at all;
they're just a part of the shading model, of little concern to a ray trace
researcher trying to speed up ray intersections or somesuch.  No one in his
right mind (currently) shoots a distribution of rays to find out the specular
highlight contribution of each light source.  In our ray tracer we tend to
call highlights the "specular" contribution, and set "reflectivity" and
"transmittance" to determine the contribution of reflected & refracted rays
(note that we don't use the S word for these).  This usage is mostly due to
having built onto an exist library (HP's "Starbase" graphics library) with
its own terminology, but we should recognize that this library is widely used
and accepted.

	So, my point is just that "specular" and "specularity" are adjectives
that have very different meanings depending on context.  I don't have any
great solution, but find the problem interesting.  Do we want to put forward a
general definition of "specular" to mean the non-uniform part of the
distribution of light from a surface?  Sounds reasonable to me, but then we
have to give specific transport mechanisms definitions that don't rely on the
word "specular" to describe them, e.g. we would talk about the amount of
contribution from a reflection ray in ray tracing as "reflectivity", perhaps;
the reflection distribution from light sources to the eye would be the
"highlight".  Calling these very different mechanisms (one involving shooting
rays, another one sampling a distribution function) both "specular
contributions" may be true, but is not descriptive terminology.

All for now,

Eric Haines

Hi Everyone,

I'm not sure how useful this is going to be as a point for comparison, but
I have finished an approximate calculation of a simple rectangular space
with diffuse surfaces.  I wouldn't guarantee the accuracy to six places,
but it should be enough to get us agreeing on ballpark answers, units
and so forth.  Most of the numbers are within 1%, but a few may be off by 
as much as 5%.

The basic space is a 10 by 6 by 3 rectangular room (length units are
irrelevant, but think of them as meters if you like).  At the center
of the ceiling is a single square fixture that measures .5 on a side.
The (monochromatic) emittances and reflectances are as follows:

	Surface		Emittance (w/m^2)	Reflectance (%)

The final radiosities are given below for each surface.  The calculation
points are separated by .5 in each dimension, starting .25 from the edge.
The given coordinates are measured from the origin at one corner of the
room.  The longer wall is aligned with the x-axis, and the z-axis points up.
Since the room has quadrilateral symmetry, calculations are given for just
one corner of the room.

All values were produced using the algorithm presented in my `88
Siggraph paper.  These numbers may not be what is needed to validate
a new calculation, but I would be curious to see how they compare to
more conventional radiosity calculations.

Where is the unsend command when you need it?  Besides a spelling error or
two, the example calculation I sent out has some problems in the labeling
of the results columns for the X and Y walls.  Namely, the coordinates for
X-WALL should be X and Z (rather than X and Y) and the coordinates for the
Y-WALL should be Y and Z.  Sure gives you confidence about the numbers,

Eurographics Working Group on Rendering

Following a successful workshop on "Photorealistic Rendering", held
in June in Rennes, France, a meeting was held during the Eurographics
Conference in Montreux 3-7 September 1990 to form a Working Group on Rendering.
The working Group will be a platform for discussion and activities on 
subjects related to image synthesis and high-quality rendering techniques.
As main topics were selected:
 - radiosity and ray tracing
 - illumination models
 - texture mapping
 - sampling, filtering, anti-aliasing
This does not exclude other subjects such as: display algorithms in general, 
VLSI and multi-processor implementations, curved surfaces, etc.

A second Workshop on Rendering was announced to be held in May 1991 in 
Barcelona, Spain. Exact dates will follow. The Workshop will be organized by 
Xavier Pueyo.

Researchers who are interested to join the Working Group are requested to
contact:

Subject: comparison with greg's data
Status: RO

We finally finished doing a radiosity solution to compare with
the solution greg posted a while ago. We just used progressive
refinement radiosity, using the hemi-cube only for form factors
(no ray tracing, no analytical factors). We used 100x100 resolution
on the top of the hemisphere. All the walls were discretized into
.5 x  .5 squares. For most points our results different from
Greg's by a few per cent -- except for some wall points and
several floor points which varied from Greg's solution by 10 to
20 per cent.
It would be very interesting to compare with some non-hemicube, and/or
non-progressive refinement results. If you would like our numerical
results, let me know & I can mail them to you.

Also, I have finished a Monte Carlo solution of the little stick 
geometry Dan mentioned quite a while ago. The file formats I use
aren't standard, but if you are interested anyway let me know and
I can give you information how to ftp the results.

Subject: symbolic solution of integral equations
Status: RO

Any experts out there on the symbolic solution of integral equations
such as the rendering equation?  Here's a problem for you:

--------
From: ph@miro.Berkeley.EDU (Paul Heckbert)
Newsgroups: sci.math
Subject: solve this integral equation
Date: 15 Nov 90 02:27:00 GMT

Can you solve the system of integral equations:

    u(x) = u0 + c*integral(v(y)*x*y/(x^2+y^2)^(3/2), y, 0, 1);

    v(y) = v0 + c*integral(u(x)*x*y/(x^2+y^2)^(3/2), x, 0, 1);

for the unknown functions u(x) and v(y) given constants u0, v0, and c?
Here, "integral(f(x),x,a,b)" is integral of f(x) with respect to x from a to b.

I've been unable to go beyond two terms in the Neumann series.
These equations describe diffuse interreflection of light in a corner between
two walls at right angles, where u(x) is the intensity or "radiosity" along
one wall, v(y) is the intensity along the other wall, the direct illumination
terms are u0 and v0, and reflectivity is 2*c.

I'll be publishing a paper "Implementing Progressive Radiosity with User-
Provided Polygon Display Routines" in the next Graphics Gems. This paper
comes with source code (you provide the polygon display routines) to 
perform standard progressive radiosity (Cohen et. al., SIGGRAPH 88). Since
the display routines are provided by users, it can be implemented with ray
tracing, z-buffer or any hardware you have. The program does not have 
any i/o file formats but you should be able to define them for it. 
A test program is included to render the Cornell red and blue room (with two
boxes inside). It might be intesting to do some benchmarking on the same test 
image.

Hi, Greg,

I have talked with Eric Haines about standard test package for radiosity. I

Could you add me to your list on this, if there is one, I am also interested
in this subject.

About myself, I developed a Raytracing/Radiosity/FastZbuffer package when
I was in Germany. I am now a visiting fellow at the Univ. of Sydney.

Believe it or not, I have actually run across this before.  When I implemented
the Cook/Torrace shading model a few years back, I had to spend a lot of 
time looking through various colorimetry books.  Most of the reflectance
data I needed was either in "Color in Business, Science, and Industry,"
or "The Thermophysical Properties of Matter." In one of these books, probably
the former, I saw data for skin reflectance of various human ethnic
groups.  For a complete bibliographic citation, see "A Reflectance Model
for Computer Graphics" by Cook and Torrance, from SIGGRAPH '81.

The Catmull paper is reproduced in an IEEE collection of graphics articles,
edited by Beatty and Booth.  I believe the title of the collection is 
something like "Computer Graphics: A Tutorial, 2nd Edition".  This book
may well be in your library, or you can order directly from the IEEE.  It
is a handy addition to any graphics researcher's library, since it collects
many hard-to-find articles from the early days of the field.

Good luck in your search.

Date: Wed, 12 Dec 90 17:57:32 GMT


With rendering, we have a noun "renderer" which is easy to decline (for
all intents and purposes :-) and a verb "render" that's easy to conjugate:
"What rendering method are you using?" "How fast can you render this scene?"


With ray tracing, it is similar "I wrote a ray tracer".  "When we trace
a scene, foo happens."

With radiosity, uh...
"I wrote a radiositizer." "When I radiate this scene." "My radiator code
is broken." ("You should drive a VW bug, then." :-)

So, what's a good everyday verb to use for radiosity?  "radiosity solver"
is a tad long for informal use.

I use "radiate", personally.  "Let's radiate this scene and see what
it looks like." has such a nice ring to it...

As far as the article goes:  so, what do you call it?  Around here environments
get "radiositized", which is quite a mouthful (and sounds vaguely dangerous,
to boot:  "How many millirems of radiation is emitted when you radiositize
something?").

Greg:
	Rick Beach, the proceedings editor, is in charge of selecting the
cover images for the SIGGRAPH proceedings.  I understand that these images
are normally chosen from the papers that are accepted for the proceedings.
There are a few other places that exceptional images can be printed, such
as in the cover of the technical program.  But unless you have a paper
accepted for the conference, I believe that there is no hope of getting you
space in the proceedings.
	Why don't you ask Rick Beach for further info:

	beach.siggraph@xerox.com

Let me know if I can help further.

Here at Apple I work with Eric Chen, so when I see one of his radiosity
pictures, I usually exclaim "Wow Eric how long did it take you to cook
that database?" or "Ummmm...nicely cooked scene Eric." So I'm a fan
of the word: cook. It's short, it's sweet, it's to the point. I feel
it fits well with the whole field having it's origins in heat transfer.

I got the mailing list for the European "Rendering working group" from
Xavier Pueyo the other day (finally) so rather than put everybody from that
list on globillum automatically, I emailed each of them asking them if
they'd like to join.  In case you're interested, my note and the list
I got from Xavier (edited into .mailrc form) follow:

Subject: globillum mailing list

Dear fellow renderer:

I received your email address from Xavier Pueyo as someone who might be
interested in participating in the "globillum" electronic mailing list
that Greg Ward and I started at SIGGRAPH '90 in August.

The globillum mail group consists of 30 people in the United States and
Canada at present.  Our discussions center on algorithms for simulating
global illumination in a general, accurate manner.  Many of us are
interested in generalizing methods to handle both diffuse and specular
surfaces.  Most of us use ray tracing or radiosity algorithms or some
hybrid.  There has been significant discussion of validation methods
for algorithms (how do you find a "correct" solution when an analytic
solution is not possible), sharing of bibliographies, and agreement on
terminology.  Mail traffic among us varies between one message every
two weeks and several per day.  Anyone can post a message to the group
(you simply email to a special address at my machine here at UC
Berkeley) and it will go to everyone else in the group.  Because the
mail goes to so many people we ask members not to post messages
frivolously; we don't want the discussion to degenerate into a free-for-all
as has the comp.graphics newsgroup on USENET, for instance.  On the other
hand, the exchange of ideas made possible by a global electronic
network is very exciting, and we look forward to sharing interesting
ideas with many of you.

If you would like to join the group, email me your most reliable email
address and perhaps a brief summary of your interests.  Also tell me if
you would like a copy of the past discussion in our mail group, which
amounts to about 200,000 bytes.

Status: RO

At Michael Cohen's suggestion, I got in touch with Kadi Bouatouch
and Xavier Pueyo to invite European researchers to join our "globillum"
mailing list.  From Xavier I got a list of members of the
"European Rendering Working Group" that Xavier and Kadi collected after the
Eurographics workshop in Rennes, France last summer.  I sent mail to
all of those (about 22) inviting them to join our group if they were
interested in discussing global illumination.

Several of them joined, so here's an updated list of members of globillum.
We're now up to 41 people.

(For most of the Europeans I've included paper-mail addresses and a
brief list of interests that they mentioned.  I include this information
for them but not the Americans and Canadians mostly because most of the
North Americans have met each other, but have not met the Europeans.
If people would like it I could collect similar info from everyone.)

Subject: finite element methods for global illumination
Status: RO

To rejuventate discussion in "globillum", I suggest that those of us
who just submitted SIGGRAPH papers, who feel comfortable about it,
summarize their papers for the rest of the group.  Even those who
didn't submit a paper might want to describe their current
global illumination work.

A note about the propriety of discussing work-in-progress and
distributing paper drafts electronically:  I think email can help
augment published journals and conferences without displacing or
subverting them.  Each has its place:  published papers provide the
permanent record and reference; email is great for fast international
communication and brainstorming.  I'm not attempting to influence the
siggraph review process in the slightest, but rather I'm interested in
sharing my ideas with others, and hearing their ideas, so that we can
all improve our methods, hopefully resulting in even better published
papers in the future.  I think it would be inappropriate to distribute
entire papers electronically, if they have been or ever might be
copyrighted, but distribution of abstracts is another matter.

To get things started, here's the abstract of a paper I just co-wrote
with Jim Winget.  I follow it with a terse summary of the paper's ideas.

Also, in the course of my work, I came across some new references in
the computer vision, thermal radiation and finite element literature
that might be of interest to others.  Send me your references, I'll
collect them and mail them to everyone.

Finite Element Methods for Global Illumination

Paul Heckbert, UC Berkeley
Jim Winget, Silicon Graphics

(SIGGRAPH '91 paper draft, 8 Jan 1991)

ABSTRACT

The interreflection of light between surfaces is governed by
an integral equation.
Existing radiosity algorithms transform this integral equation
into a system of linear equations.
Such algorithms are simple applications of the finite element method.

Techniques are presented for applying more advanced finite element techniques
to the global illumination problem in order to yield more accurate results.
First, piecewise-linear, piecewise-quadratic, and higher order elements
are discussed as a superior alternative to current piecewise-constant
radiosity assumptions.
Second, Galerkin techniques are a more robust alternative to current
point collocation (point sampling) techniques.
Finally, occlusions in a scene give rise to discontinuities such as shadow
edges in the solution function.
{\it Discontinuity meshing} is introduced as a technique for resolving these
discontinuities by adaptive placement of element boundaries.
Illustrations, algorithms, and results are given for
two-dimensional {\it radiosity in flatland} problems.

Terse summary for globillumers:

Global illumination is governed by a Fredholm integral equation of
the second kind.  This equation is called the "rendering equation"
in computer graphics circles [Kajiya86] and the "mutual illumination
equation" in computer vision circles [Koenderink-van Doorn,
J. Opt. Soc. Am, June 1983, p. 843;
Forsyth-Zisserman, Proc. Comp Vis & Pat Rec, 1989 (CVPR '89), p. 466].
Radiosity algorithms typically ignore the errors introduced during their
discretization step.

In fact, existing radiosity algorithms are a simple form of finite
element method.  Existing methods use piecewise-constant elements
during form factor calculation (the Gouraud shading commonly used for
output is just a "display hack", in my opinion), they evaluate form
factors only from polygon centers (or vertices), and they often use
uniform polygonization meshes.  In finite element jargon, these three
assumptions correspond to the use of piecewise constant elements, point
collocation methods, and uniform non-adaptive meshes.

Accuracy of the radiosity solution functions can be improved on all three
fronts: piecewise-linear, -quadratic, or higher order elements can be
used to improve approximation fit; Galerkin techniques can be used in
place of point collocation to improve the faithfulness of the discretized
problem to the continuous problem; and a priori "discontinuity meshing"
can be used to choose a subdivision mesh (e.g. polygonization) that
can resolve discontinuities in the solution function.
(Discontinuities in value arise at shadow edges from point light sources
or at shadow edges where surfaces touch or intersect.
Discontinuities in slope occur at penumbras arising from area light sources
casting shadows caused by separated objects.)

Most of the above is illustrated in a reduced-dimensionality world we call
"radiosity in flatland".  Many global illumination ideas are easier to
visualize, implement, and compare in flatland, making it a good testbed.
Our results are 2-D so far.

Some of our main sources of inspiration:
    [Kajiya86] for emphasis on integral equation.
    [Baum89] for emphasis on need for more accurate form factors.
    [Ward88, Campbell90] for emphasis on adaptive sampling/meshing of radiosity.

I suppose I was the last person to get the Feb. Sci. Am., so everybody
has probably already discussed this. Can anybody tell me how they did
the beams on the cover? Was it a simple post-process approximation, or
something more complicated? Is the museum picture on p. 109
supposed to look significantly different on either side of the white
stripe? My favorite statement from the article is "Radiosity is not
only fast (after the initial calculations have been done)..."

I've only seen a colleague's copy, not having gotten to a bookstore yet, but
I noticed a disturbing printing error (or so I think) in the museum image that
was on the SIGGRAPH 1988 cover:  what's that white lower-left to upper-right
stripe?  Argh!  (I read the caption, but not the whole article:  if there's
some reasoning for the stripe in the article, I've missed it.)

Answers on the Scientific American article (Feb., with radiosity images by
Don P. Greenberg):

- The image with the white diagonal stripe across it (the full image also on
the cover of the SIGGRAPH 88 Proceedings) is indeed two separate images, and
it's meant to show how you can change colors easily.  I had the same comment
("Hey, what's that white stripe, a printing error?").  My guess is that the
images were generated for the SIGGRAPH 88 cover with minor variations in color
schemes tested, so there probably weren't any images available that were
radically different.  So, it's probably a real life example, but unfortunately
you can't really see much difference in the colors.  Any Cornellians who were
actually there have any comments based on more than conjecture?

- Actually, there was a bug I noticed: Ronchamp was spelled Ronchamps in the
article.  Rats.

- I came up with the technique for the beams of light from the windows.  It's
not "true" atmospherics (a la Rushmeier), but (although you can't tell from
this particular shot) the beams do blend with the environment (i.e. beams
behind a pew are not seen, etc).  Don pressed us for some beams for a bunch of
weeks, and finally I came up with a technique that could compute in a finite
amount of time.  Basically, I use the windows to define a set of beams, then
stochastically sample these volumes and add in the contributions.

What's funny is that the beams look "realistic" compared to my mental image of
what beams of light should look like.  However, I then actually found a real
picture of Ronchamp with beams of light coming in, and the beams are in fact
very sharp edged!  One detail that adds to the "realism" of the real picture
is that the stained glass has variations in it, giving the beams of light
variance within them.  If I show Ronchamp images rendered with un-stochastic
beams of light (i.e. perfectly sharp edged), people don't like them because
they feel they're unrealistic.  I wonder if this is a case of people having
seen too MUCH computer graphics, where almost everything has sharp edges.
Also, maybe people recall beams of light coming out of the clouds (where the
beams are usually not sharp edged) - we don't see stained glass as much, I
guess.

It's interesting to me how much context matters:  if you show someone a
picture and say "this is my kitchen," they go, "OK".  If you say, "this is a
computer graphic rendering of a kitchen," they go "Oh, yeah, you can see the
following problems..."

I remember seeing Cindy Goral's radiosity rendering of the sculpture (name
forgotten) on the computer screen for the first time, and not questioning it
at all - I was convinced it was a scanned-in photo of a real sculpture.  Part
of this effect was that this was the first radiosity image (other than the
inside of a patriotically colored empty box) of anything, and we weren't used
to seeing them at all.  The image didn't look like a scan-line rendering or a
ray trace, so it looked real.

Reminds me of AI research:  whenever some difficult task is mastered by a
computer (e.g.  play chess well, etc), this is taken to mean that the task is
not proof of intelligence.  When we develop a new rendering technique, it
becomes part of our vocabulary and we are then less often fooled by images
which use these soon old techniques.

Enough stories for now,

Some more history:

One guess is that the editors got two images of the museum, one brownish, and
one blueish (I remember these variations) and then the printers tried to
get them to match. Who knows? It could happen!

Also, if you remember the Meyer et al articles with the experiment in which
we sat people down to look at the REAL vs. RAD images, the "public" did
 better job of finding the REAL image than the graphnics. The graphnics
picked the radiosity image to the real one since as everyone knows (or at
least knew then), simulated images have sharper edges than real ones.

I suspect there are plenty of situations in which you can fool people if
that is your goal.

The museum picture in Feb. Scientific American is ideed two separate images
with different floor colors. The original museum I created for Siggraph88 
cover had a blue carpted floor (i.e., the right one in S.A.). But I was 
told that blue won't reproduce very well in printing. Therefore, the floor 
was changed to brown (i.e., the left one in S. A.) in the final image. 
The two images actually looked quite different on the screen. The color 
bleeding effect propagated to the whole museum and gave the blue one a cool 
tint and the brown one a warm tint(i.e., the walls and ceiling are all neutral
grey). The image on Siggraph88 cover was printed directly from digital 
data(i.e., It was quite scary actually because the printer never knew 
what the image was supposed to look like before the printing and we didn't 
see the image until it was printed. We were afraid the color would be 
completely off because of all the gamma and white point corrections. 
It turned out very well--maybe a little bit on the yellow side 
just to be picky). I think the two images S.A. used were from slides shot
from screen directly. By the time they printed on paper, all the subtle
color variations were pretty much lost already. 

If you ask me about the S. A. picture, I'll say the diagonal stripe sucks.
They could have used a thin vertical white line to split the picture into two 
halves. The bold diagonal line is rude and destroys whatever is left in 
that picture.

Well, I haven't submitted any papers for Siggraph in quite a while, but
I'm happy to talk about my research.  (The way things are going, this may
be the only place you'll ever hear about it...)  Hopefully, people who
are interested in the same kinds of things will give me feedback or offer
suggestions.

1.  Z-buffered animation from ray tracing
	Actually, this is a hack for getting fast animations out of
	ray tracing renderers.  Basically, I store a z-buffer with
	the ray-traced images sampling every N timesteps, and perform
	z-buffer rendering on individual pixels for the frames in between.
	This work is more or less finished, I just need to have someone
	write it up for me!

2.  Bidirectional reflectance distribution function measurement and modeling
	We have been developing an instrument for quick measurement of
	the BRDF's of different materials and are looking at various
	mathematical models for reproducing the data with a few
	parameters.  Everyone is familiar with the Phong model, most people
	have heard of the Torrance-Sparrow model (I challenge anyone to
	write it down from memory), but there are quite a few other
	models to choose from, and no one seems to have found the answer
	for every class of surface.  If you have BRDF measurements of
	architectural surfaces, or a pet reflectance model, please let
	me know.  (Holly Rushmeier has been kind enough to share
	her research in this area with me.  Thanks, Holly!)

3.  Fast direct calculations for ray tracing
	I have developed a moderately successful technique for reducing
	the number of shadow tests necessary for computing the direct
	component of a ray tracing calculation.  The approach falls
	more along the lines of something Pete Shirley mentioned in
	his 1990 GI paper than Eric Haines' light buffer algorithm
	in that it trades speed for accuracy rather than speed for
	memory.  If anyone's interested, I'd be happy to share details.

4.  Improved daylight calculations
	Actually, this is what I hope to be working on in the near
	future.  Current methods are hopelessly inadequate when it
	comes to modeling intense sources of highly directional
	radiation bouncing about off of (sometimes specular) room
	surfaces.  The solutions I plan to explore fall along the
	lines of what Paul Heckbert has been investigating with
	bidirectional sampling techniques.

That's the official agenda.  Don't ask me what I've really been doing!

I'd be interested in hearing about your shadow-test algorithm.  I talk
about Shirley's in my book.

I like the stuff you and Paul are doing with sampling.  I want to be
able to put radiosity into my ray tracer, but most schemes are not
general enough to deal with arbitrary objects in the scene.  Something
along the lines of what you worked on is sure to be the answer.

We are also working on a version of Shirley's algorithm with an efficient 
calculation of the direct component. We are using a shadow coherence method.
We tried to submit a paper for Siggraph but missed the deadline (paper was
sent by express mail on Jan 4 but failed to be in Provo, Utah by Jan 9 - can 
we have an address in Europe next time?).

We will submit a new version of the paper to the EG rendering Workshop in
Barcelona, Spain (see Call for Papers in previous newsletters).

Subject: Image file formats
Status: RO


I'm rewriting my code from scratch (a yearly exercise :^}), and am writing
output routines now.  I want to leave my options open for image manipulation
at display time, so I'd like a general spectral image format.  If there were
no space constraints, I'd want something like:

	Header (number of pixels, number and location of spectral samples,
	        interpolation rule between samples)
	Pixel values (spectral radiance float for each wavelength)

I'm now thinking that a slight modification of what Greg Ward uses would be
enough, where the pixels are stored with one byte per spectral sample, and
a one byte exponent.  Has anyone tried this?  Greg, is there any problem,
in practice, using one byte precision?

Dear Pete and Glob,

The only drawback with a one byte per spectral sample plus one byte shared
exponent format is that it is limited to an accuracy of about 1%.  If you
need better accuracy at each sample, you will have to go to more bits.
Frankly, unless you are going to smother the visible spectrum with sample
points, I don't think that the 1% error in each sample is going to be
very significant compared to whatever interpolation technique you apply.

I would be very interested in whatever format you come up with.  Have you
thought about compression techniques?  It's been my experience that
Lempel-Ziv as employed by compress on an uncompressed image does pretty
well, and is certainly easy to implement(!).  I use run-length encoding
with my three-sample (OK, so I admit it's just RGB) format, and compress
still manages to squeeze the result down to 50% of the original size in
most cases.

Subject: image-file headers
Status: RO

Tom Duff and I designed a "picfile" format six years ago that Bell Labs
uses.  The biggest win is that headers are variable-length ascii, an
idea that we have found very useful.  A basic header is:

	TYPE=dump
	WINDOW=0 0 1280 720
	NCHAN=3
	<blank line>
	<data begins>

It assumes only that that there is a 2-dimensional array of samples,
that each sample is NCHAN bytes long, and that this data is encoded in
some way specified by TYPE (dump, runcode, bitmap, ccitt-g4, etc).  You
do a picopen and picread, and you get one row of decoded data.  Data is
usually uchars, floats, or complex in our applications.

You can add any additional attribute=value lines in the header.
Usually, there is higher-level information that application programs
deal with.  Command history is also kept around by most of our software
tools.  A typical header is:

	TYPE=dump
	WINDOW=0 0 640 768
	NCHAN=3
	CHAN=rgb
	COMMAND= piccat WHEELS.frand IN EXPER.WHEELS.frand 
	COMMAND= FX
	COMMAND=  picjoin JUNK1 JUNK2 OUT 
	COMMAND=   resample 320 IN JUNK1 -igamma 1 -ogamma 1

I submitted a paper to SIGGRAPH this year:

    Spectrally Optimal Sampling for Distributed Ray Tracing

			abstract

Distributed ray tracing is a multidimensional extension of the
conventional ray tracing algorithm.  Like all ray tracing techniques,
it suffers from the aliasing problems associated with point sampling.
In conventional ray tracing, a theory of two-dimensional nonuniform
sampling exists which describes how aliasing can be converted into
high-frequency random noise.  Nonuniform (stochastic) sampling is an
integral part of the distributed ray tracing scheme; and in this paper,
the two-dimensional theory is extended.  An implementation demonstrates
that aliasing in motion blur, shadow penumbras and depth-of-field
focusing can be driven into higher frequencies by appropriate sampling
strategies.  By driving noise into higher frequencies, it can be more
completely removed by filtering and is less conspicuous to the human
observer.

Hey, hey!

It seems that I use the exact same variable-length header format as Don
in my picture files!  (Even with the blank line to indicate the end of
header and command history to boot!)  I think this kind of independent
consensus deserves some kind of special recognition.  All we need to
do now is agree on variable names.  (Actually, this is the same problem
TIFF has with user-definability.)

requesting to join the globillum group.  In his (papermail) letter, he said
that he and a friend have recently written a radiosity program for IBM PC's

I thought you might want to communicate with him, especially since you'll
be over in Europe soon.

He is:

Hello G.I.s (Global Illuminators, of course...)

I'm new to the group and I just read the old issues (thanks Paul).

I want to come back --- just for a moment --- on the diffuse/specular
discussion that was suspended without being closed. Why ? For me, the
reason is that "diffuse" and "specular" are terms that everyone has been
using for years. So very strong semantic mental associations have been
created for each of the terms in our minds... and who can easily break his
mental associations (isn't it Sigmund ?)

The problem comes from the fact that we want to give subjective names to
scientific notions. The solution that I propose --- that should be appealing
for our scientific brains (!) --- is to take the ONLY objective term that
characterizes our surfaces that is the >> shape of the distribution function <<

Three categories can be exhibit :

	Uniform distribution (UD)
	Delta (or Dirac) distribution (DD)
	Potatoid distribution (PD)

I think the 3 terms are unconfusing because everyone knows what a uniform or
a delta distribution is, and everyone can imagine how a potatoid distribution
looks like (potatoes can really have any shape !) To get in link with the
recent discussion in comp.graphics, some very nice sentences could appear in
the globillum community :

	"I cook the scene using a new potatoid distribution"

Why not create a gastromic award for the next SIGGRAPH ?

More seriously, diffuse & specular can be used in papers, according to the
writer's mental associations, but the new terminology offers an easy way
to explain these personal meanings at the beginning of the paper.

Well, the word "potatoid" certainly isn't the right one. In fact, I don't
know if it ever exist in english : it is a litteral traduction from french.
I have think about Free Form Distribution (but FFD is already used),
Irregular Distribution or General Distribution... I don't have enough english
vocabulary to find a better one.

As far as we are speaking about terminology revolutions, what about throwing
away the term "radiosity method". Sure there are a lot of historical reasons
for the word. But radiosity does really have a sense only in diffuse
environments, speaking of radiosity in general environments, especially when
your are using IES units instead of heat transfer units, sounds odd. As stated
by Peter in his thesis, "radiosity method" --- at least progressive radiosity
--- can be viewed as a light transfer simulation (I don't remember the real
term he used) instead of a linear system resolution. So what we are using
here in Bordeaux for several months, and what I propose to the community is :

	Iterative Light Distribution (Method)
  or	Progressive Light Distribution (Method)

Well, that were my five cents (three cents tax for oversea message !)

I agree with Christophe's suggestion of dropping "radiosity method".  I
think that what we are really talking about is finite element analysis of
light transfer, and the UNIT radiosity has very little to do with the
general problem.  In fact, I can't really use the term for my work at all

So, here's another definitional question:

Progressive radiosity is called "Progressive Radiosity".  What shall we call
the other kind(s) of radiosity where the full matrix is computed & solved?
"Full Matrix Radiosity", "Full Solution Radiosity", "Simultaneous Equation
Radiosity" (and you thought that the term "radiosity" was lengthy), or just
plain "Radiosity"?  I don't like just "Radiosity", since this seems like it
should be an overarching term which includes the progressive algorithm.  Also,
one more thing to consider is Pat Hanrahan's hierarchical structuring work for
"Full" radiosity - he's taking some of the matrixness out of things and
replacing them with a different structure (though of course a matrix of some
sort could be derived from his solution scheme).

I guess we could turn to the world of advertising and have "Radiosity Lite"
(for progressive rad) and "Radiosity Dry" (in honor of those boring fine-white
elephant, that is to say, finite element books always referenced in papers
about the full matrix solution).

I'm interested in any answers ASAP, as I need the term for the extended
abstract for the Barcelona workshop.

When we came up with the term "full matrix radiosity," we considered
several alternative but couldn't think of anything more descriptive.
I like the term in that it suggests that the matrix is assembled and
stored unlike progressive refinement.  However, it would be nice if
the name implied that the "full solution" is also computed directly,
unlike the progressive refinement.

I have always been disturbed by radiosity terminology.  First, I think
the language of Illumination Engineering and Radiometry should be used
instead of heat-transfer jargon.  I'd like to hear people talk about
"direct component of illumination" (local) and "interflected component"
(global) and "diffuse interflected" and "specular interflected".

Secondly, we should not confuse algorithms with shading effects.  There
may be many ways to compute various components of illumination.  Ray
tracing [Ward] or path tracing [Kajiya] or light textures [Shirley and
Heckbert] are distinctly different algorithms from what I think of as
the "Cornell Algorithms" of computing form factors between faces and
solving a matrix.

When people say "radiosity" it is not always clear whether they mean
the Cornell algorithm or the diffuse interflected component of
illumination.  In Greenberg's recent Sci Am. article, he talks about
radiosity versus ray tracing.  I think he is talking about algorithms
in that case.

How about:

    MATRIX RADIOSITY		a la Goral, Cohen85
	where the kernel of the integral operator is discretized in a
	lattice of rows and columns (a matrix) and stored in its entirety.

    PROGRESSIVE RADIOSITY	a la Cohen88
	where the kernel is sampled a column at a time, as part of the
	iterative algorithm for solving the system of equations

    HIERARCHICAL RADIOSITY	a la Hanrahan90
	where the kernel is discretized (sampled) adaptively,
	as in Warnock's hidden surface algorithm or in quadtree subdivision

Perhaps if progressive (iterative, on-the-fly) variants of hierarchical
radiosity and other variations come along, we'll need composite names like
"progressive hierarchical radiosity", etc.

I'm undecided on whether what we're now calling "radiosity algorithms"
should be renamed, to distinguish it from radiosity (the unit).
Greg and Don make good arguments that the name "radiosity algorithm"
is misleading.  The most viable, concise alternative I've heard is
"zonal methods".  Any others?

Subject: nomenclature - Don Mitchell's remarks

I completely agree with Don's first remark. We should decide on a terminology 
on the level of shading components: "direct diffuse|specular reflection" and 
"diffuse|specular inter[re]flection". 

It would also be convenient to have different terms for the preprocessed 
(stored) intensity at the patch:
  ? radiosity: total diffuse and specular reflection
  ? radiosity: total diffuse component
  ? radiosity: diffuse interreflection component
I do not have any idea what to suggest for the "?"s.

Talking about radiosity vs ray tracing makes sense if you talk about the 
shading components that can be modelled with traditional radiosity and 
traditional ray tracing algorithms, but it is indeed confusing with the
terminology of the algorithms (matrix vs shooting).

    We are currently working on developing a  book  on  this  subject
    which  we  hope to have published in the Spring of 1991. The book
    will graphically demonstrate the state of  the  art  in  computer

    professions  of  architecture  and  visualization.  We expect the
    nature of the illustrations to be impressive  enough  to  capture
    the interest of a very broad section of the population.  The main
    point of the book is to capture  the  brilliant  images  produced
    from  the  synthesis  of two artistic endeavors, architecture and
    computer graphics.

A Ray Tracing Framework for Global Illumination Systems
         by Shirley, Sung, and Brown

The fundamental software components useful for a zonal ray tracing
system are described.  The interface protocols and some implementational
observations are outlined for each of the key components.  
Components for sampling, ray-object intersection, and 
zonal (radiosity) calculations are emphasized.
Some results from a global illumination program assembled 
from the components are discussed.

"Making Radiosity Usable: Automatic Preprocessing and Meshing Techniques
for the Generation of Accurate Radiosity Solutions"

by Baum, Mann, Smith, Winget

(to appear in SIGGRAPH '91)

Few end-users, such as architects and designers use radiosity
since generating accurate solution of real world environments
is user-intensive and requires significant knowledge of the method. 
The output of most commerical modeling packages must be substantially
"cleaned up" to satisfy the geometrical and topological criteria
imposed by radiosity solution algorithms.  Furthermore, the mesh
used as the basis of the radiosity computation must meet several
additional requirements for the solution to be accurate.

A set of geometrical and topological requirements is formalized
that when satisfied yields an accurate radiosity solution.  A
series of algorithms is introduced that automatically processes 
raw model databases to meet thse requirements.  Thus, the end-user
can concentrate on the design rather than on the details of the 
radiosity solution process.  These algorithms are generally
independent of the radiosity solution technique user, and thus
apply to all mesh based radiosity methods.

Shaft Culling for Efficient Ray-Traced Radiosity

Eric Haines, John Wallace
3D/Eye Inc, Ithaca, NY

In radiosity algorithms, much time is spent computing visibility between two
surfaces.  One approach to approximating this visibility is to use ray casting
methods.  A new algorithm is presented which takes advantage of object
coherency when using ray casting for radiosity.  An efficient method is
presented to form a volume between the emitter and receiver, and then generate
a candidate list of items partially or wholly within the volume.  Using this
list, ray casting is performed to determine the amount of visibility between
surfaces.  Statistics are presented showing the decrease in overall
computation time compared to a traditional ray casting technique.

----

My hundred word summary:

When doing ray casting for radiosity there are a number of areas where
different forms of coherence can be used, e.g. for a step of progressive
radiosity, the light source is always one of the endpoints of all rays.  Also
in radiosity, rays endpoints can be derived directly before any ray testing is
done (as opposed to ray tracing, where the ray must be shot in order to derive
the origin of the reflection, refraction, and shadow rays).  The scheme is a
hybrid of bounding volume hierarchies and 5D ray tracing with some interesting
optimizations for testing boxes against the shaft (a shaft being defined as
the volume of space between two elements being tested for visibility).


This paper will also be a part of the Frontiers in Rendering SIGGRAPH course
notes, and the Barcelona Workshop will eventually appear as a Springer-Verlag
book, so it won't be totally inaccessible to all.

ABSTRACT

A new  progressive global illumination method is presented which
produces approximate images quickly, and then continues to
systematically produce more accurate images. The method combines the
existing methods of progressive refinement radiosity, Monte Carlo
path tracing and light  ray tracing. The method does not place any
limitation on surface properties such as ideal Lambertian or
mirror-like.  To increase efficiency and accuracy, the new concepts
of light source reclassification, caustics reconstruction, Monte
Carlo path tracing with a radiosity preprocess and an interruptible
radiosity solution are introduced. The method presents the user with
most useful information about the scene as early as possible by
reorganizing the method into a radiosity pass, a high frequency
refinement pass and a low frequency refinement pass. The
implementation of the method is demonstrated, and sample images are
presented.

Automatic Termination Criteria for Ray Tracing Hierarchies

K.R.Subramanian and Donald S. Fussell
Department of Computer Sciences 
The University of Texas at Austin

A common problem in space subdivision hierarchies used in ray tracing
is determining the proper termination criteria to stop subdivision. 
We propose a cost model based on scene characteristics that can be 
used to predict the correct termination point to optimize performance. 
The characteristics are determined as the hierarchy is being built. 
The model is applied to a variety of space subdivision schemes to 
test its accuracy. Experimental results indicate the power and usefulness 
of this model when applied to some standard ray tracing benchmarks.

Linear Radiosity Approximation using Vertex-to Vertex Form Factors
  by Nelson Max and Michael Allison
  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

Abstract
Using radiosity computed at vertices, the radiosity across a triangle can be
approximated by linear interpolation. We develop vertex-to-vertex form factors
based on this linear radiosity approximation, and show how they can be computed
efficiently using modern hardware-accelerated shading and z-buffer technology.

Basic idea:
Use the red and green channels to represent two of the three barycentric
coordinates of a triangle, and the blue and alpha channels to record the
polygon id. Then the data in a z-buffered hemicube at a vertex can be used
to efficiently get the vertex-to-vertex form factors, by summing a 
barycentric coordinate times the hemicube delta form factor into the 
appropriate vertex index, obtained from the polygon id.

The paper also discusses the modifications necessary to handle a vertex which
belongs to two separate surfaces, for example, along a corner between two
walls of a room. The paper may never get published, because the referees
thought it was not original enough, but I hope to generalize it to higher
order polynomials, using finite element ideas.

linear interpolation. I think a number of other people have too. Using
the hardware z-buffer is really clever. I use all the channels for the
surface id, as though someday I'm planning to do millions and millions
of surfaces.
What kind of improvements did you find using the new factors? I assume
they were significant or it wouldn't be worth looking at higher orders.

I derived a solution for factors from edge vertices (I think):	

Let dA1 be the origin of the coordinate system, and let the z-axis
be aligned with the normal to surface dA1. Let A2 be defined by
the coordinates (a,b,c),(0,d,0) and (0,-f,0). If d and f are both
not equal to zero I obtained:

FdA1-A2 = (1/2PI) {2a/sqrt(a**2+c**2) times 
                     asin(sqrt(a**2+c**2)/sqrt(a**2+b**2+c**2)
                       + PI}

The cases for d=0 or f=0 are a bit messier to write out. Overall it
makes sense to me that the result doesn't depend on d and f(the length
of the edge), but just on the orientation of A2 relative to A1.
Has anybody else looked at this or the corner case?

Synchronous Refinement: An Efficient Radiosity Solution for General
Global Illumination Simulation
Ning Zhang, School of Electrical Engineering, University of Sydney

Previous hybrid algorithms for global illumination simulation are
limited in a combination of ideal diffuse and mirror-like specular
reflectance models. In this paper we present an efficient, general
solution of global illumination for general reflectance distributions.
We use an extended progressive refinement algorithm, which defines
our solution framework, to propagate both diffusely and specularly
reflected energy in a synchronous way so that bidirectional reflectance
distribution functions can be directly used for accurately
computing light energy transfer between surfaces. Our solution involves
a distribution classification/merging method to keep time and
space complexity under control.  We employ the combination
of geometry and illumination criteria for adaptive sampling. Finally
flexible control of energy propagating in the synchronous refinement
may make the solution applicable to an incremental radiosity solution.

Basic idea: The algorithm is an attempt to put Immel's algorithm in progressive
radiosity. Radiosity distribution is represented by hemi-sphere instead of
hemi-cube (a reviewer suggested that it could be represented by spherical
harmonics in frequency domain) and stored for shooting patches only.

This paper is the extension of some sections in the last paper.

Two Methods for Speeding up Form-factor Calculation 
Ning Zhang, School of Electrical Engineering, University of Sydney

Method 1: Extended Hemi-cube
 
Every point in triangles or quadrilaterals, which are commonly used in
radiosity, can be addressed by (u,v) index values. By storing (u,v)
vaules in the hemi-cube buffer, only one rotation,projection and scan-
conversion for all elements of a polygon.

Method 2: ``Cache-pool'' scheme for Ray-casting

The rays fired for determining form-factor between an emitter and a receiver
are bounded in a limit volume like a shaft. We use Kay/Kajiya's algorithm
to build a global hierarchy (tree) structure for the scene and use the
`shaft volume' to prune the tree for building a `cache-pool' which can be
used for reducing the traveling in the tree.

Hi Everyone,

Just thought I'd throw in the abstract of the paper I will present
at the European Rendering Workshop in Barcelona this May:

	Adaptive Shadow Testing for Ray Tracing
	Greg Ward, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory

ABSTRACT
We present a simple technique for improving the efficiency of ray
tracing in scenes with a large number of light sources. The sources are
sorted according to their potential contribution, and only those
sources whose shadows are above a specified threshold are tested.  The
remainder are added into the result in propor- tion to a statistical
estimate of their visibility.  The algorithm requires very little
storage, and produces no objectionable artifacts.

CONCEPT
In scenes with many light sources, only a few will create strong
shadows in any one part of the scene.  These will generally be the
sources with the highest concentration of light in that section due to
source brightness, direction and proximity.  The remainder of the light
sources will contribute, but without causing any significant contrast
gradients.  Since it is contrast that stimulates the human visual
system, lack of contrast translates to low importance for visual
studies.  This observation leads to a simple optimization:  we can
perform shadow testing on the sources with the highest potential
contributions first, and quit testing when the remainder of the
contributions is below some threshold.  By itself, this approach will
ensure an absolute error bound equal to the given threshold.  However,
it is still not optimal since we don't know what to do with the
remainder of untested sources.  Do we add them all in, leave them all
out, or add in some and leave out others?  How we answer this question
in effect determines the efficiency of our algorithm.  If we do a good
job guessing at the visibility of light sources we don't test, our
results will be very closer to those of the full calculation without
the associated cost.

I am glad to hear Eric H. say that the proceedings will be published.
I have been relishing the copy Peter Shirley made for me of last year's
proceedings.  (Thanks again, Pete!)

Adios!
-Greg

Hi Francois,

I'm now in Switzerland, banging away on another keyboard.

I hope that your papers were accepted by Siggraph -- they are very good!
I just got a closer look at the paper by Xiao on light reflection models,
and I wanted to get ahold of him directly with some questions I had.
Can you give me his e-mail address?  I could also ask you the questions,
but I imagine that you are busy enough as it is.

Au revoir,

Subject: Info on Barcelona workshop

The program of the Barcelona workshop is completed. It contains 25
presentations on the following four subjects:
 - rendering equation (sampling strategies) 6 papers
 - efficient radiosity methods (discretization, visibility preproc.) 8 papers
 - parallel ray tracing/radiosity (multi-proc. implem.) 6 papers
 - visualization (general)
A total of 20 papers on global illumination! Plus the presentations
of the two invited speakers (Sillion and Ward). I think the program gives
a very interesting overview of current research on radiosity. 

There will be a preprint of the proceedings available at the workshop.
The workshop itself, however, is only open for the participants and
the authors of the not-accepted papers. So if you are not among them then 
you have to obtain a copy of the papers from one of your friends. The 
official proceedings will be published by Springer verlag, but that will 
take some time.

Source selection for the direct lighting computation in global illumination 

Arjan J.F. Kok
Frederik W. Jansen
Delft University of Technology* 
The Netherlands

Abstract 
Computation of the global illumination in a scene can be improved by 
separating the direct component of the lighting that is received by a patch 
directly from light sources, from the indirect component that is received 
by intermediate interreflection from other patches. The indirect component is 
calculated during the preprocessing and is stored as the radiosity shading at 
the patch. The direct component is calculated during the rendering phase by 
tracing shadow rays like in conventional ray tracing. The number of shadow 
rays can be reduced by exploiting shadow coherence, and by making a selection 
for the number of light sources that are taken into account for the direct 
lighting computation. Different criteria to select these sources are given.

Key words: radiosity, global illumination, source sampling

As you see quite similar to Ward's presentation. We maintain during the 
preprocessing for each patch a list of the n strongest (shadow contrast
creating) light sources and sum the contribution of the rest to the 
preprocessed radiosity that is stored at the patch vertices. Different
criteria can be applied to determine n and to decide how many shadow
rays should be cast during the rendering phase. The techniques are very
effective and give high-quality pictures (with both sharp and soft shadows).

	Divide and Conquer Radiosity.
	----------------------------
	Robert van Liere
	CWI, Amsterdam

ABSTRACT (of an extended abstract)
----------------------------------

We present a parallel algorithm for solving the radiosity equations.
The implementation of the algorithm is well suited for shared memory 
multi-processor systems.

The basic idea of the algorithm is intuitively described as follows :

1. Divide a scene into a number of disjunct subscenes.
   A subscene boundary is modeled as an ideal translucent surface;
   i.e. the boundary can pass on light to the adjacent subscene
   without modifications.

2. Apply a fixed number of iterations of the progressive refinement solution 
   process to each subscene.

3. Transfer the accumulated energy on the translucent boundary 
   of each subscene to the adjacent subscene.

4. Render all subscenes. Boundaries are not rendered.

5. Goto step 2.

Although we have limited ourselves to diffuse environments,
the algorithm can easily be extended to specular environments.

In the paper we use existing ``standard'' methods to do
convergence and error analysis of the solution process. We
provide empirical support for this analysis by using a complex
scene as a test case for 1, 4, 8 and 16 subscenes.

Finally, we touch upon forthcomming work :
	+ determining heuristics for optimal subscene subdivision
	+ dynamic subscene subdivision
and last but not least :
	+ MINIMIZING MEMORY CONSUMPTION OF BOUNDARIES !!!!

I sent an abstract of my SIGGRAPH 91 paper to you all some months ago.
Right now I am agonizing over whether to change the title from

	Spectrally Optimal Sampling for Distributed Ray Tracing
to
	Spectrally Optimal Sampling for Distribution Ray Tracing

I don't think I will change it.  My feeling is "Distributed Ray
Tracing" is not the best name, but everyone in graphics knows exactly
what it means.  We all talked about this issue before.  Cook's
algorithm could be called

	Cook Ray Tracing
	Distribution Ray Tracing (probably the best proposal)
	Monte Carlo Ray Tracing
	Multidimensional Ray Tracing
	Stochastic Ray Tracing

But if you do this, somewhere in your paper you will have to say:

	"...where by "Foobar Ray Tracing" I mean distributed ray
	tracing [Cook84,Cook86]."

I figure as long as you have to say that, then it is just confusing
to use a variety of non-standard names for it.

Following in the recent burst of abstracts, here is a working draft of
the abstract from my MSc thesis, due out in August (I hope).
	-Paul

Presented is a progressive radiosity algorithm using progressive adaptive
refinement of the scene into patches between which to compute form
factors.  Instead of subdividing prior to rendering, I propose a method
of adaptively subdividing the scene bassed upon the change in radiance
over a surface.  The subdivision is accomplished by creating convex
non-overlaping patches positioned at the model's surfaces over which
the radiance is near constant, aproximating the surface.  The patches
are represented as disks with arcs cut from them, whose radii are
related to rate of change of the illumination on the surface being
approximated by the disk.  Patches are generated adaptively by sampling
the radiance of a surface using ray casting techniques.  Patches found
to overlap can be subdivided by inserting appropriate chords and
appropriately redistributing their radiances.  By using known
illumination information the sample points and restructuring as more
information becomes known the subdivisions come to fall along shadow
edges and other discontinuities in the scene.  An efficient method is
presented for storage and lookup of these patches.  An extension is
also presented allowing specular interactions and caustic effects to be
properly simulated.

Analytic Illumination with Polygonal Light Sources

A. T. Campbell, III
Donald S. Fussell
Department of Computer Sciences
The University of Texas at Austin
Austin, TX 78712

Modeling the effects of finite-sized light sources has been an active area
of research for many years.  Most methods simplify the problem by 
approximating the area source with a collection of point sources.  The only 
existing analytic methods work in screen space to compute a single image.  
This paper presents an object-space algorithm to model illumination from 
polygonal light sources.  The result is a collection of smooth-shaded 
polygonal facets which may be rendered from any viewing position.  Binary 
Space Partitioning trees are used to compute the umbra and penumbra boundaries 
efficiently.  Fast analytic techniques are developed for illumination 
calculations.  Numerical optimization techniques are used to sample the 
shading function in unshadowed regions finely enough to find all significant 
illumination gradations.  Illumination calculations are optimized to 
concentrate computational effort on parts of the scene where they are most 
needed.

ABSTRACT

Global illumination rendering involves the simulation of light
interreflections between emitting and reflecting surfaces. Accounting
for global illumination is necessary in the quest of generating images
indistinguishable from real photographs. However, computing global
illumination effects is a difficult problem and no published algorithm
is capable of simulating all the effects in a reasonable amount of
time so far. In order to facilitate the experimentation of new global
illumination algorithms, we propose a research testbed designed for
this purpose. The testbed is object-oriented and encapsulates the
basic components of rendering into classes that can be derived and
overridden easily. The testbed allows new geometry, shading methods and
display architecture to be added orthogonally. We have implemented a
number of new rendering algorithms with the testbed and results are
demonstrated.

Does anyone know the whereabouts of Ning Zhang?  He was supposed to be at the
Barcelona Eurographics Workshop but didn't show.  I used to write him at:

# Ning Zhang - Radiosity, Raytracing, Image Compression
# School of Electrical Engineering
# The University of Sydney
# NSW 2006, Australia
# + 61 (02) 692 2962
alias	ning_zhang	nzhang@ee.su.oz.au

but it bounced.  I wrote the systems administrator, who forwarded the note to
"H Yan", who once worked with him but didn't know where he had gone.  Can
anyone tell me where he's located (email address, in particular)?

I'm interested in talking with him as his extended abstract for the Barcelona
notes was very similar in approach to our "shaft culling" algorithm for
radiosity ray-casting.  A great example of parallel independent development,
in fact.  Anyway, I wanted to discuss this topic further.

Any help appreciated,

Does anyone care to summarize what was going on in the Barcelona rendering
workshop? I saw a listing of the names of all the papers supposed to be 
presented but that's as much as I know. Will the papers be publshed and
what were the hot topics?

I just got back from the Eurographics workshop on object-oriented graphics
(held in Texel, an island north of Holland). There wasn't a lot of papers 
related to rendering. As a matter of fact, mine is about the only one on 
rendering. However, there was a lot of dicussions on object-oriented design
and how it can help in developing graphics systems. For people who are doing
a lot of system development work, you probably want to check out the current
state of object-oriented technologies. The papers presented in the workshop
will be published by Springer-Verlag (may take a year). The next workshop
is tentatively decided to be held in Geneva next winter (you skiers take note).
There will be a panel and a tutorial in this year's Siggraph about object-
oriented graphics.

Summaries of papers presented at the second Eurographics Workshop on 
Rendering
Barcelona, Spain, 13-15 may 1991

Gregory Ward
Adaptive shadow testing for ray tracing
Method for reducing the number of shadow rays for scenes with a large 
number of light sources. The sources are sorted on their contribution, and 
only for the most important sources rays are cast. The influence of the 
other sources is estimated statistically. Tests are done with different 
tolerances (threshold to determine whether sources are important) and 
certainties (rate of accuracy). The method gives good reduction and is 
able to find the most important shadows because it selects contrast as 
criterion.

Francois Sillion
The state of the art in physically-based rendering and its impact on 
future applications
Describes recent developments in radiosity such as incremental changes 
(for changing geometries), use of general reflection functions and 
hierarchical algorithms. The paper gives also an overview of some 'new' 
problems such as error metrics, discretization (meshing, adaptive 
refinement). Also the problem how to separate modeling and rendering is 
discussed.

Christophe Schlick
An adaptive sampling technique for multidimensional integration by ray-
tracing
Describes a sampling method that includes the following characteristics: 
adaptivity, irregularity, complete stratification, importance sampling and 
uncorrelation. It allows a fast reconstruction. Implementation is done 
using look-up tables.

Brigitta Lange
The simulation of radiant light transfer with stochastic ray-tracing
Describes a stochastic ray tracing method based on "the rendering 
equation" and using path tracing. Importance sampling is performed by 
distributing the samples for the diffuse and specular reflection on basis 
of the reflection properties. 

David Kirk, James Arvo (no presentation)
Unbiased variance reduction for global illumination
Application of Monte Carlo method, using an importance sampling 
probability function  (ISPDF) and stratification.

Peter Shirley, Changyaw Wang
Direct lighting calculation by Monte Carlo integration
Application of Monte Carlo techniques for rendering scenes with multiple 
light sources. Only one shadow ray per viewing ray is used. Some issues 
for the design of probability densities for light sources are given.

George Drettakis, Eugene Fiume
Structure-directed sampling, reconstruction, and data representation for 
global illumination
Discusses methods to use knowledge about the modeling and viewing 
parameters for rendering scenes. A structure-directed framework based on 
oracles (decision making processes) is presented. 

Arjan Kok, Frederik Jansen
Source selection for the direct lighting component in global illumination
Describes criteria for deciding which patches should be considered to be 
light sources in a two pass method in which direct lighting component is 
calculated separately in the second pass.

Filippo Tampieri, Dani Lischinski
The constant radiosity assumption syndrome
In progressive refinement the radiosity of the shooting patch is assumed 
to be constant. This is not correct. It is better to take into account the 
variation of the radiosity of the source. A progressive refinement method 
is given that takes into account the non uniform radiosity distribution of 
the shooting patch.

Christophe Vedel, Claude Puech
A testbed for adaptive subdivision in progressive radiosity
Describes problems related to adaptive mesh subdivision for progressive 
radiosity. Experiments with different subdivision criteria such as linear 
or quadratic gradients were reported. For the storage for the radiosities 
a binary tree structure is used.

N. Gatenby, W.T. Hewitt
Radiosity in computer graphics: a proposed alternative to the hemi-cube 
algorithm
A hemisphere discretization method. The hemisphere is split in triangular 
regions with nearly equal areas.

Pierre Tellier, Kadi Bouatouch
Physics-based lighting models: implementation issues
Describes a two-pass method. Scenes are discretized in points instead of 
patches. To calculate the formfactors more efficiently a visibility graph 
is used.

A. Anderson, M. Grant
Visilux: a radiosity based lighting design tool
Describes the Visilux lighting simulation system designed for Philips.

Laszlo Neuman, Csaba Kelemen (no presentation, extended abstract)
Solution of interreflection problem for very complex environments by 
transillumination method
Describes an efficient method for the interreflection problem.

Eric Haines, John Wallace
Shaft culling for efficient ray-traced radiosity
A shaft is a volume between an emitter and receiver. A list of enclosing 
boxes, c.q. patches that are in that volume is generated. The ray casting 
to determine visibility between emitter and receiver can be reduced by 
only testing the rays against the patches in the shaft. Methods to make 
the shafts, and to determine which object are in the shaft are given.

Ning Zhang (no presentation, extended abstract)
Two methods for speeding up form-factor calculation
Describes almost the same method as Haines, and a method to speed up the 
hemi-cube method.

Martin Feda, Werner Purgathofer
Progressive refinement radiosity on a transputer network
Describes progressive refinement radiosity method implemented on 
transputers. The transputers are separated in two networks connected by a 
master transputer. The worker network performs the radiosity calculations, 
and the renderer network continuously generates images.

Alan Chalmers, Derek Paddon
Parallel processing of progressive refinement radiosity methods
Describes parallel processing radiosity shoot methods on a transputer 
network. Comparisons are made between different processor topologies 
(ring, hypercube, torus, AMP). The AMP (a minimum path) configuration 
shows the best results.

P. Guitton, J. Roman, C. Schlick
Two parallel approaches for a progressive radiosity
Describes ray tracing based progressive radiosity implemented on a 
transputer network.

J.P. Jessel, M. Paulin, R. Caubet
An extended radiosity using parallel ray-traced specular transfers
Describes a parallel extended radiosity method. The method is implemented 
on a parallel architecture dedicated to ray-tracing (based on 
transputers).

Veysi Isler, Cevdet Aykanat, Bulent  Ozguc
Subdivision of 3D space based on the graph partitioning for parallel ray 
tracing
Describes a heuristic algorithm to subdivide the 3D space by converting 
the problem into a graph partitioning problem 

Robert van Liere
Divide and conquer radiosity
Describes an algorithm that separates the scene in different subscenes by 
placing virtual walls. Each of the subscenes is solved with a progressive 
refinement method (on separate processors if necessary). After all scenes 
are solved, energy is transfered from one subscene to another. Then the 
radiosities are again solved independently for the subscenes.

Bruno Arnaldi, Xavier Pueyo, Josep Vilaplana
On the division of environments by virtual walls for radiosity computation
Divide the scene in local environments by putting virtual walls in the 
scene. The formfactors within a local environment are calculated (can be 
done in parallel). Then one global system of equations is made from all 
the local environment subsystems. This system is solved to get the 
radiosities. 

Georgios Sakas, Bertram Kernke
Texture shaping: a method for modelling arbitrarily-shaped volume objects 
in texture space
Describes a fast approach for generating density functions defining volume 
objects of arbitrary shape based on textures.

Ingeborg Tastl, Werner Purgathofer
Color spaces and human color perception
Describes the construction of a colorimetric system that better conforms 
to the human color perception.

P.A. Brivio, P. Furini, M. Righetti, D. Marini
Synthesis of multispectral images of natural landscape
Generation, visualisation and rendering of natural landscapes.

Salvador Clave, Markus Gro'
A rendering pipeline for street lighting simulation
Describes the rendering pipeline used for the simulation of street 
lighting. Physical surface light sources with distribution curves are 
used.

Hi Don,

I'm afraid that I don't have a nice PostScript version of the paper.
The best I can do is a MicroSoft Word 4.0 document (passed through
binhex on the Macintosh) and some encapsulated PostScript figures.

I can also send you a hardcopy of the paper as it appeared in the
preliminary proceedings, or you can wait for the final version that
should be ready in a couple of weeks.

I received this note a little while ago from Christophe Schlick about his
Barcelona workshop paper.  His paper, on adaptive sampling for Cook's
distributed (stochastic, or whatever you call it) ray tracing, looks worth
trying out, and so I thought I'd pass on the bug in the course notes version
of the paper:

----

About my paper, if you want to try the technique, you should notice
that there is an mistype error on page 7 (discovered by Greg Ward).
On page 7, in the recursion relation for sigma, the arguments on the
left-hand side are (i) and (i+2^n) instead of (2i) and (2i+2^n).

REPORT ON THE SECOND EUROGRAPHICS WORKSHOP ON RENDERING

Introduction
Following a successful workshop on Photosimulation and Realism in 
Computer Graphics held in 1990 in Rennes, France, a second workshop was 
held this year from 13-15 May at the Polytechnical University of Catalunya 
in Barcelona, Spain. The main topics covered by the two invited speakers 
and the 23 paper presentations, organized in four main sessions, were ray 
tracing, radiosity, multi-processor implementations of ray tracing and 
radiosity, and rendering applications.

Rendering equation
Photo-realistic rendering strives to calculate the global illumination in 
a scene by sampling the diffuse and specular reflected light between the 
surfaces (patches) in the scene as accurately as possible. Conventional 
ray tracing techniques sample only the light reflected by a patch that is 
received directly (with or without indirect specular reflection) from 
light sources. Extended ray tracing tries to solve the complete 
'rendering equation' by sampling also the light that is diffusely 
reflected by a patch and that was received from all other patches in the 
scene. Alternatively, or in combination with these sampling techniques, a 
radiosity preprocessing can be applied to estimate the radiosity of (the 
vertices of) each patch. The sampling efficiency can be increased by 
stochastic (importance) sampling and deterministic (structural, 
directional) sampling methods that direct the sampling effort to those 
areas where important contributions may be expected (i.e. the light 
sources). This can either be done by applying knowledge about the 
environment (position of light sources, etc.) or by adapting the sampling 
directions during the sampling process. An open issue is whether 
stochastic techniques are really required, or that deterministic sampling 
techniques are sufficient.
In his invited presentation Ward presented a method that samples the 
light of the most important light sources and estimates the received 
energy of the other light sources by applying the same probability factor 
found for the important light sources to these light sources too. 
Schlick presented an adaptive stochastic ray tracing method based on a N-
rooks sampling technique that distributes samples pseudo-randomly in 
image space while still allowing easy reconstruction. Lange presented 
techniques and weighting factors to implement Kajiya's path tracing 
algorithm for diffuse and specular reflection. A paper by Kirk and Arvo 
discussed the use of conic shafts oriented towards the light sources to 
localize those directions where the sampling density should be increased. 
Shirley and Wang proposed a probability function for shooting one ray at 
a time to sample light from multiple light sources simultaneously. 
Drettakis and Fiume discussed the use of structural knowledge about the 
scene and the rendering process to reduce the number of samples to 
represent a given illumination. Kok and Jansen described a two-pass 
algorithm that uses the information from a radiosity preprocessing to 
identify the most important light sources, to which in a second pass 
shadow rays are cast to improve the shadow accuracy of the patch 
radiosities.

Efficient radiosity methods
Pure radiosity methods calculate the diffusely reflected light by a patch 
by a radiosity preprocessing with a projective (hemi-cube or hemi-sphere) 
method or with ray tracing. Improvements are sought in a better 
discretization of the hemi-sphere and in new adaptive patch subdivision 
techniques to represent more accurately shading gradients. Also 
visibility preprocessing and spatial subdivision techniques are of 
interest. In his invited presentation, Sillion reviewed a number of 
recent developments, i.e. incremental radiosity changes caused by moving 
objects, general reflectance distributions for bidirectional diffuse and 
specular reflection, and hierarchical algorithms to handle complex 
scenes. Reliable error estimates (a good error metric) and adaptive and 
automatic patch meshing techniques for complex scenes, remain open 
issues.
Tampieri and Lischinski proposed to take into account the distribution of 
light over a shooting patch while shooting to other nearby patches. 
Vedel and Puech proposed the use of radiosity gradients to check the
soundness of linear interpolation and to choose elements for subdivision.
Gatenby and Hewitt described a triangular hemi-sphere discretization. Tellier 
and Bouatouch reported on a visibility preprocessing that uses a visibility 
graph. Haines and Wallace described a shaft culling algorithm that 
reduces the number of ray object intersections for a bundle of rays shot 
from one patch to another by calculating a shaft volume between the two 
patches and culling those objects that do not intersect the shaft volume.

Parallel radiosity
Multi-processing is an interesting option for radiosity and ray tracing. 
Rendering times can be reduced and large model data bases can be 
distributed over the processors. Model distribution can be based on 
spatial subdivision techniques. Load distribution can be done by 
distributing the rays over the processors and passing model data between 
the processors, or by communicating rays between processors. With a 
progressive radiosity algorithm, additional information has to be 
broadcast to determine the patch with the highest unshot energy. 
Quadratic performances can be avoided by hierarchically subdividing the 
scene into cells that are separated by virtual walls. A global solution 
is then derived after several iterations from the local solutions.
Feda and Purgathofer described a multi-processor architecture with one 
master processor and two subsystems for radiosity preprocessing and 
rendering; the rendering improves continuously as the radiosity solution 
progresses. Chalmers and Paddon compared different network topologies, 
such as ring, hypercube, torus and a minimum path configuration, which 
seemed to perform the best. Guitton, Roman and Schlick compared a 
stochastic and a deterministic (each ray directed to a specific patch) 
shooting method. Jessel, Paulin and Caubet exploited a voxel space 
partitioning to distribute the model data over the processors. Isler, 
Aykanat and Ozguc converted the load distribution problem into a graph 
partitioning problem that is solved by a heuristic algorithm. Experiments 
with virtual walls implementations were presented by van Liere, and by 
Arnaldi, Pueyo and Vilaplana.

Visualization
The final session covered two papers on colour and texture, and three 
papers on general rendering applications. Sakas and Kernke modeled 
texture-shaped objects by combining object shape and three-dimensional 
texture in the frequency domain, and converting the result back into the 
space domain. Tastl and Purgathofer reported on experiments to obtain a, 
for human perception, uniformly distributed colour space. Anderson and 
Grant presented a radiosity application for lighting design in buildings. 
Brivio, Furini, Righetti and Marini showed an application of rendering 
techniques to visualization of natural terrain models obtained from 
satellite data. Clave and Gross presented results of city street lighting 
simulation.

Discussion
During the discussion two groups could be discerned, one group interested 
in 'really' realistic images and an other interested in interactive use of 
rendering. In the '256 rays per pixel is not enough' camp one tries to 
address topics such as how to model and render human beings in bright day 
light, how to render natural scenes, how to model light sources, etc. In 
the 'animation' camp one focusses on efficiency improving techniques and 
multi-processor implementations. Both camps, however, face the problem of 
how to measure the accuracy of their simulation and how to model real 
complex scenes. Ward offered to make his models ftp-able and invited others 
to contribute to the model base too.

Conclusion
The workshop brought together 47 participants from 11 countries including 
Canada and the US, who enjoyed an interesting program. The workshop was 
well organized by Xavier Pueyo and his staff. By the good quality of the 
invited and contributed papers, the EG workshop on rendering has established 
itself as a meeting point for those working on and interested in 
photo-realistic rendering. The third EG workshop on rendering will be 
announced during the Eurographics'91 conference in Vienna.

Radiosity For the Connection Machine (CM-2)
-------------------------------------------

CMRAD Version 2.0 is now available via anonymous FTP from calpe.psc.edu
(128.182.62.148) or by request from gifford@cmf.nrl.navy.mil (134.207.7.4).

CMRAD is a data parallel two pass renderer for the CM-2.  The first pass
is a progressive radiosity renderer with ray traced form factors and
adaptively subdivided elements.  The second pass consists of a relatively
straightforward ray tracer that uses the radiosity solution for shading.
Polygonal output from the radiosity pass can be rendered using a standard
graphics workstation.  Output from the second pass can be displayed on a CM
framebuffer or other color device.

CMRAD has a wide range of options to let you play with just about all the
parameters of the radiosity pass.  It has an equally wide range of defaults
so it isn't terribly difficult to get started.

CMRAD does not support any standard scene input language, although it
does come with a hierarchical input format of its own to make scene
generation easier.

This package comes with enough documentation to get the renderer up and
running.

Neither the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center nor the Connection Machine
Facility of the Naval Research Laboratory officially support this
software.  All questions, comments, and bug reports should be directed
to gifford@cmf.nrl.navy.mil (or) gifford@a.psc.edu.

	Reconstruction and Data Representation for Global Illumination".
	A first proposal can be found in the EuroGraphics workshop this
	year in Barcelona.
	I am looking into using sampling and filtering techniques as
	well as properties of both the scene and the rendering  process,
	to achieve equivalent or better quality at a significantly lower

I received a letter from Andy Newton which I thought of interest to the group.
He has a somewhat different slant on things due to his application area.  So,
with his permission and without further ado, here 'tis.

Eric Haines

--------------

I was at SIGGRAPH '89 and attended the ray tracing tutorial which was great.
About the only credit point I can claim in CG is to have pointed out to 
Andrew Glassner that the "1 over R squared" rule of energy attenuation only
applies to point energy sources. 'Fudge factors' for attenuation are exactly
what we need to avoid. I must admit that this jaundiced me a bit about
ray tracing in computer graphics but hopefully I've seen the error of my
ways. Back to the story ..

I work in a satellite image interpretation research group. Our interest in 
ray tracing is for simulating all parts of the process of the formation of 
satellite images - optics, camera motion, atmosphere, surface scattering and
global (as in hemispherical!) light source illumination. We do work at two
scales - where the basic scene is a DEM (height grid) and for very complicated
3-d scenes for plant canopy reflectance simulation.

So ray tracing is a really powerful tool to allow us to simulate as many parts
of these complex processes as we can model but what we need to do is not quite
computer graphics.  What I mean by this is that what we need out of our models
are accurate, truthful, energies (in real units) not measures of visual
brightness.  We need physical results.  One example of this is wavelength
sampling by importance sampling a spectral response curve as opposed to
treating light as an RGB 'colour'.  (Though I can't recall any references to
doing exactly this it is proposed in Cook's original stochastic sampling
papers and my implementation is very similar to his for reflected ray
direction).

Our main problems are (i) illumination from such a big light source (the sky
hemisphere) with 'diffuse' reflectors (ii) ensuring that we model energies
correctly and (iii) using physical directional reflectances.  I may be going
out on a bit of a limb here so please excuse me if I do - I'm not as familiar
as I ought to be with general CG practise - but I'll try to explain what I
mean.

I've spent the better part of 3 years supporting and trying to add to a tracer
I inherited when I came to work here.  Now that has turned out not to be
particularly smart as its been a lot harder to modify and bug fix than if it
was my own work.  Anyway the point is that through out most of that time we
had no good model for the directional and spectral variation of that thing
outside the window - the sky.  As our main interest is _supposed_ to be the
satellite work, not the graphics, I felt we couldn't come to grand conclusions
from our results if the illumination function was simply not representative of
the real world.  Now I've managed to solve this problem by implementing a
model of atmospheric scattering processes due to Zibordi and Voss so its time
to make the physics correct and BTW write a fresh tracer.  I have seen some
work on CG models of the sky which are functional and not physical.  This
model is quite fast enough to create a sky radiance LUT at any resolution
required on a per scene basis so if you know of anyone out there who needs a
model of the sky's irradiance maybe I could help.

The thing about any such illumination model is, of course, that the energy
results are per steradian of solid angle of illuminating source.  With the
point sampling infinitesimally thin ray what solid angle does a ray reaching
the sky have?  If its a primary ray then ok it can have some solid angle
associated with the pixel but how should ray solid angles be transformed by
reflection etc?  The only work I've seen that is remotely like this is
Amantide's cones.  However that doesn't use the geometric concept of a solid
angle.  One plus point of considering solid angle is of course that the
effects of distance attenuation by divergence are implicitly included.  So I'm
very interested in how much solid angle is used as yet another ray parameter
in more general CG work.  Is this really common, or unheard of?

There's a reflectance concept in remote sensing called Bi-Directional
Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), which may also be use in CG or have
a parallel, that defines directional reflectance as a 5-d array of pairwise
directional spectral reflectance coefficients.  For each wavelength
(quantised, of course), for each incident direction (over the 2 Pi
hemisphere), for each emergent direction, define a reflectance coefficient.
Such things can be used as reflectance LUTs or integrated, subdivided and
importance sampled.  Are similar things done for interesting material
reflectances in the main stream?

----------------------

His reply to my reply (which I don't include here):

The global illumination mailing list you mention sounds very interesting - 
please do go ahead and post my note to that list and I'll contact Paul
Heckbert about joining. The SIGGRAPH paper you mentioned also sounds good
- some colleagues here are representing BRDFs as spherical harmonics,
which is obviously storage efficient but storage as a set of precomputed
importance sampling intervals should be more computationally straightforward.
I'll definitely check out the paper when my proceedings arrive.

Although the graphics is more fun than the Remote Sensing this is what I'm
supposed to be doing ...

Applying ray tracing to the understanding of remote sensed images of the
natural world, mainly satellite imagery.  Much more interested in physical
accuracy than efficiency.  Also how to correctly model, and sample, very large
and non-uniform light sources (the sky!)  in ray tracing.  How to relate the
point sampling paradigm of the infinitessimal ray to light energy transport.
Physical reflectance models like BRDF.  Doing distance attenuation and
variable light source sampling properly (probably) using solid angle.

I'd be really interested in any references anyone has to ray tracing for
physical process simulations or radiance calculations using solid angle as
a ray property.

On offer: a realistic sky radiance model based on atmospheric scattering.

Thanks Eric for forwarding Andy Newton's note.Here are a few
thoughts I had about it:

There is working going on combining graphics & remote sensing.
Chris Borel at Los Alamos (I think he's in globillum, he is
at ccb@eos1.lanl.gov) has calculated BRDF's for plant canopies
using the radiosity method on individual leaves (thousands of
them). His first paper on this appeared in Journal of Remote Sensing, and
I think others will follow.

Attaching a solid angle to rays is one way to think about the 
solution of the equation of transfer for accurately calculating radiances.
Another way to think of it is that ray casting is just a way of
evaluating the integrand at in a stochastic direction (of the radiance
on a surface, or of the source radiance in a volume) or at a stochastically
chosen point on a path (for the path integral of source radiance from the
nearest opague surface). Jim Kajiya introduced these ideas in his '86
Siggraph paper, but didn't elaborate on the details of area sources
or ambient participating media. It took me a while to figure out the
details for my thesis, I imagine a number of other people have been
through the same thing.

The only physically accurate ray tracer available in public domain
(or any place else) that I know about is
is Greg Ward's Radiance. We're using it for a computer vision 
project where accuracy is important. I'm using it instead of my
homemade stuff because it is well documented and reliable.
 It doesn't include participating media, but if
you wanted to build your own system to do that I think that
 Radiance would be a good place to start.

Hello Andy,

Since I've been put in temporary charge of the globillum mailing list
while Paul is touring Europe, I took the initiative and added your name
so that you should get any future mailings.  If you don't, just let me
know...

Let me be the first to take you up on your offer of a better sky 
radiance model.  We have been using the CIE standard sky distributions
for our work in daylighting for some time.  It is physical but not
always accurate because of the difficulty in determining the atmospheric
turbidity and the variability of cloud conditions in general.  I would be
happy to provide you with some code for calculating this function if
you are interested.

By the way, I hope that Eric referred you to the excellent paper by
Takagi et al that appeared at Siggraph `90.  It sounds like many of
your concerns were at least touched on briefly by them.

As for BRDF's, I have been working myself with Ken Turkowski under
contract from Apple Computer on reflectance measurements and models for
computer graphics.  I suppose that Eric told you already about the
paper by He, Torrance and Sillion in this year's Siggraph.  This is
probably the best physical model developed to date for isotropic
reflection, though it is somewhat challenging to implement.  (It took
me weeks to get it right.)  For anisotropic BRDF's (reflectances that
change with azimuth), even the measurement is challenging.  The few
companies in the US will characterize a single surface for you for a
few thousand dollars.  I don't know about your budget, but this kind of
expense sure doesn't fit in mine.  So I've been working on a faster,
cheaper gonioreflectometer.  (Report forthcoming... I hope!)

Regarding rays and associated solid angles, I just want to agree with
Holly.  If importance sampling is used in such a way that geometric
factors (ie. cosine weighting for irradiance) are considered, all
rays will be associated with equal (projected) solid angles.  The ray
values can then be added together and multiplied by the total (projected)
solid angle and voila!  It is fortuitous that such an implicit use of
geometry also results in the best a priori sampling distribution.
However, if you find during the sampling process that certain areas call
for more rays than others, you can go ahead and sample these areas more
densly as long as you remember to change the weight of the associated
rays accordingly.

The process I have been using to calculate irradiance (with reasonable
success) is to divide the hemisphere into equal projected solid angles
and send one ray in a stochiastically selected direction in each.  This
starts me out with a fully stratified Monte Carlo sampling.  Then I
estimate the variance contributed by each region and send extra samples
to those regions that need it the most.  The new rays are simply
averaged in with the old ones for each region and the final summation
is pi (the projected solid angle of a hemisphere) times the average of
all the regions.  Again, you are welcome to take a look at the code if
you like.

If you want to get more code than you can shake a stick at, Radiance
is available from anonymous ftp on hobbes.lbl.gov (128.3.12.38).

Status: RO

Hi Andy,

I'm keeping my response public because I'd be interested to hear what others
have to say on this topic as well.

First off, there must have been a little confusion in my mention of
recent Siggraph papers.  Ken Turkowski has not (yet) written a paper on
BRDF's -- the only paper I know of at this year's Siggraph was by
Xiao Dong He, Ken Torrance and Francois Sillion of Cornell.  You were no
doubt confused by my use of the word "He" in the context of my last letter.

There are two main parts to the calculation of illumination in Radiance,
"direct" and "indirect".  These parts are distinguished by the method
used to calculate the contributions rather than the sources of the
contributions themselves.

"Direct" contributions are computed by considering the directionality,
brightness, and solid angle subtended by a light source and a single
ray traced to a (jittered) location to test for occlusion.  (Large
sources are often broken up into smaller pieces to avoid occlusion and
geometric errors.)  I believe this method is similar to one you
currently employ.  I also make some approximations to avoid the
visibility testing all of the light sources, but these are probably
irrelevant to our discussion.

"Indirect" contributions are computed using a Monte Carlo sampling
of the hemisphere as I described in my last letter.  The results
of this calculation are then stored and reused for nearby values
as described in a paper I wrote for Siggraph `88.  (Actually, I
wrote it the first time for Siggraph `87!)  In this pass, any
sources encountered that were part of the "direct" calculation
are ignored -- very important for maintaining proper energy balance!

By the way, Jim Arvo referred me to a Siggraph paper he wrote this
year with David Kirk that points out very clearly that the type
of adaptive sampling I use is biased.  And that's a nasty word.

Directional reflectance properties currently must be handled either
during the direct calculation (which is view-dependent), or by
some other sampling technique such as sending extra specular rays.
(Specular and diffuse components are not non-physical, by the way.
They have very real meaning.  Specular is that component which is
reflected coherently off the surface of a dielectric material, and
diffuse is that component which is re-emitted by particles suspended
in the material.  A diffuse term implies a colloidal material, hence
it does not really apply to metals.)

For outdoor scenes, the sky component is almost always left out of
the direct calculation.  Since it represents such a large solid
angle, it is more efficient to compute the sky's contribution
intermittently using a Monte Carlo sampling of the projected
hemisphere.  The orientation of this hemisphere is given by the
surface, and the contributions of all non-source rays is included,
however they might manage to reach the sky or other "indirect"
illuminators.  The weight or "power" of these rays is
PI divided by the total number of samples on the hemisphere
for a straight Monte Carlo sampling, and the weights are modified
as I explained before for adaptive sampling.  The correct weight
is PI instead of 2*PI because it is the value of the projected
hemisphere we are interested in, not the total hemisphere.

The radiance of the sky is computed from the CIE formulas.  You
should look at the file ray/lib/skybright.cal in the Radiance
1.4 distribution, and the program ray/src/gen/gensky.c which sets
the parameters.

The only other articles on Radiance that might be useful to you
are the ones published in the Winter 1988 edition of the Journal of
the Illuminating Engineering Society and the June 1990 issue of
Lighting Design and Application.  Both are U.S. trade journals,
so I can send you reprints if you can't find them.

I don't expect the reflectometer I've been working on to ever make
it into the field.  (If you'd seen it you'd believe me.)

-Greg

P.S.  Please do send me those man pages.  And while you're at it,
please resend your last message.  I somehow managed to delete it!

Hi --
In the computer vision problem we're working on that we use Radiance
for we are also interested in calculating energy/area on a sensor
pixel for a given exposure time, that is we are calculating

integral over pixel area
          integral over solid angle subtended by finite pinhole
                       L(incident) cos(theta) dw(pinhole) dApixel

averaged over the pixel area and averaged over time. We use 
Radiance to do this basically by picking a point on the
sensor pixel, picking a point on the finite pinhole and then
using Radiance to calculate the incident radiance L from
the direction defined by the two points. Thats essentially
what we're doing, in practice we make several images for several
pinhole locations, each of which has several sample per pixel
by filtering a large image to a small one, and then averaging the
images using appropriate weight factors.

Well, I guess that isn't crystal clear. The point I'm trying to
make though is to separate out the ideas of estimated L(incident)
and the integrals over solid angle and area of L(incident) that
you need to calculate energy on the sensor pixel. You can then
make a Monte Carlo estimate of those integrals by choosing
random points, and using Radiance to accurately return
L(incident).

Hi --
In my last message I didn't give a complete reference for Chirs
(Chris) Borel's paper, it is :

C.C. Borel, S.A.W. Gerstl, and B.J. Powers "The Radiosity Method
in Optical Remote Sensing of Structured 3-D Surfaces"
Remote Sensing of Environment, vol. 36,no. 1, pp. 13-44

Also in the following issue is:

N.S. Goel, I. Rozehnal and Thompson, R.L. "A Computer Graphics
Based Model for Scattering from Objects of Arbitrary Shapes in
the Optical Region" Remote Sensing of Environment, vol 36, no2
pp. 73-104. 
In this paper an implementation of the radiosity method is described
with a revised method for calculating form factors. From a quick
reading it seems to me that they have replaced the hemi-cube with
a discretized hemisphere, and use a kind of painters algorithm for
the zbuffer. Dr. Goel reports that the computational time increases
only with N or NlogN (rather than Nsquared) for their method. He
wrote me a letter saying he was interested in comments on the
paper from the computer graphics point of view. If any of you
get time to look at the paper, his email address is
NGOEL@BINGTJW.bitnet.

Greg,

I know you're just looking after globillum for Paul Heckbert (where's he
getting to in Europe, by the way? anywhere near London?) but do you have
globillum archives or back issues I could browse? I feel maybe I need 
some background to what you guys have been discussing upto now.

Cheers,

			RADIOSITY BIBLIOGRAPHY UPDATE

I'm starting to do the yearly update of the radiosity bibliography I started
some time ago.  For "radiosity" read "global illumination related paper which
goes beyond classical scanline and ray-tracing techniques" (which is why it
gets called the radiosity bibliography instead).  The bibliography is free to
all, and is provided mostly because I enjoy providing such information to
people.

An older version of this bibliography of articles is available online via FTP
from weedeater.math.yale.edu [130.132.23.17] in pub/Papers/RadBib.shar.  If
you don't have FTP access, ask me and I'll send you the old one.

So, what I need from you all are updates.  I've already included Barcelona
workshop, SIGGRAPH '91, Graphics Interface '91 and Eurographics '91 papers,
along with a few from Visual Computer and Computer Graphics Forum.  No doubt
I've missed some.  So, if you want higher exposure for your research, please
send me any references missing from the old version.  (If you want lower
exposure, like your embarassing research paper removed from the list, hmmm,
maybe I can make money off of this after all...).

There are undoubtedly pre-1991 papers in conferences that I've missed
("Radiosity Effects of Surroundings on Golf-Balls" from the Palm Springs
Optics & Hedge-Clipping Conference comes to mind) and I'd love to list them.
If you're not sure that I have a reference, write me - the worst that happens
is that you waste a few minutes with information I already have.

Also, I have found various minor errors in a few of the references over time
(page numbers, exact date, etc).  So, please feel free to check your references
for correctness and update me.

Entries are in "refer" format:

%A James T. Kajiya
%T The Rendering Equation
%J Computer Graphics (SIGGRAPH '86 Proceedings)
%V 20
%N 4
%D Aug. 1986
%P 143-150
%K shading, diffuse reflection

and it saves me some time if you can pass them on like this.

The new version of the bibliography should be ready at this end sometime next
week (time here permitting), at which time I'll announce its availability.

To all,

	I forgot to mention:  if you have updates or corrections for the
separate "Ray Tracing Bibliography" (started by Paul Heckbert and now
maintained by me), please let me know.  Again, the older ray tracing bib is
available on weedeater.math.yale.edu in the file with "RTbib" at the start.
I'm interested in both papers directly about ray tracing algorithms, or about
using ray casting for other processes.  Technical articles only, no "isn't
ray tracing cool, look at these pictures" references please.

	Do not send me references you get directly from Rick Speer's
copyrighted postscript bibliography which came out recently (I believe a copy
is on weedeater).  Rick tells me that he's selling the un-postscripted
version, and so he says that I may not use any new references from his list.
Of course, many of his references came directly from Paul & my reference list,
but our list is in the public domain at this point, so no matter.  Also, be
warned:  Rick believes that using any of his reference list in any copyrighted
work, even copying a reference in it and using that in your paper, is a
violation of his copyright.  Whether any of this holds water legally is not my
concern - Rick feels, rightly or not, that such use is an infringement and so
I will not use his material.  As near as I can tell, there are about 50
articles/theses which he has listed which I don't have, mostly from
semi-obscure journals, or minor masters theses, or in Japanese.

	Geez, talk about a tempest in a teapot (or VW bug?)!  This all makes
me not want to maintain this bib anymore and switch to doing something more
profitable, like collecting baseball cards or something.

Thanks,

I thought I would pass on this note from Rick Speer about another good reason
one should not copy anything in his bibliography.  Rick's ray tracing
bibliography looks like a nice tool, as he has done a lot of
cross-referencing, so don't be scared off by his aggressive stance on
copyright.  Basically, don't copy anything directly from it and you'll be safe
from legal action by him and _Computer Graphics Forum_, where it was first
published (Vol. 10, No. 2, June 1991, p. 145-174).

Enough on this topic, just wanted to make sure none of you repeat my
mistaken assumptions, let's get back to research topics,

Status: R

At weedeater.math.yale.edu [130.132.23.17] in pub/Papers are two more papers
available via FTP:

	Ronchamp.tar.Z - "Ronchamp: A Case Study for Radiosity"
	Beams.tar.Z - "Beams O' Light: Confessions of a Hacker"

The Ronchamp paper discusses various problems we've encountered in using
meshed radiosity algorithms (i.e. the ones pioneered by Cornell) and some
solutions - a non-theoretical and hands-on oriented paper.  It's in the same
vein as Baum et al's worthwhile SIGGRAPH '91 Proceedings paper.

The Beams paper is a short, light paper on how we did the beams of light
effect for the Ronchamp chapel stills and movie (Scientific American, Feb.
1991, and our SIGGRAPH '91 film show entry).

The papers are in postscript, kindly converted by Juhana Kouhia.  They first
appeared in the "Frontiers in Rendering" SIGGRAPH '91 Course Notes.  Since
course notes typically are difficult to find, and since I'm not planning on
reworking either of these papers for the journals, I thought I would make them
available here.

Enjoy,

p.s. incidentally, if you don't normally read USENET news, you might want to

radiosity going on.  I particularly liked Dave George's explanations.

Subject: New results for comparison
Status: R

Hello Everybody,

As you may or may not remember, I have set up a site for sharing the results
of global illumination algorithms.  It is hobbes.lbl.gov (128.3.12.38),
reachable by anonymous ftp for both pickup and delivery.  This site also
contains the Radiance software distribution, which most of you know about.
If you don't, you will learn very shortly as I plan to announce its next
release in a few weeks.  The subdirectory containing simulation runs for
comparison is is pub/tests.

Sometime ago, I finished some new calculations on a simple space with
obstructions, specular and RGB-colored surfaces.  I still have not run
any examples with general surface reflectance distributions (BRDF's)
or more than three spectral samples.  I just got around to organizing
the results and making some postscript plots for their easier digestion.
Here is a current table of contents:

-------------------------------------------------------
			TESTS

This directory contains some test scenes and results for checking
calculations against other people's programs.  The subdirectories
are broken down according to model type as follows:

	empty/*/*	- Environments without obstructions
	obstructed/*/*	- Obstructed environments
	*/diffuse/*	- Diffuse surfaces only
	*/specular/*	- Surfaces may have some (ideal) specularity
	*/brdf/*	- Surfaces may have arbitrary BRDF's
	*/*/grey	- Grey surfaces only
	*/*/rgb		- Surfaces with RGB color
	*/*/spectral	- Surfaces with > 3 spectral samples

All models and files should be put in the bottom set of directories.
Solutions should be given in human-readable text form, and should
describe very thoroughly how they were obtained.  Please name your
files uniquely using some abbreviation of your name or group, so
we don't get name collisions when everyone starts dumping their
results into the obstructed/brdf/spectral directory (ha, ha).

There are currently Radiance-generated results in the following directories:

empty/diffuse/grey
empty/diffuse/rgb
empty/specular/grey
empty/specular/rgb
obstructed/diffuse/grey
obstructed/diffuse/rgb
obstructed/specular/grey
obstructed/specular/rgb

Most of the directories contain README files explaining their contents.
The empty/diffuse/grey directory contains results not only from Radiance,
but also from Holly Rushmeier and sometimes Sumanta Pattanaik.

--------------------------------------------------

Francois Sillion has told me that he has results he is willing to share
using general BRDF's, and I know there are people out there with
results for multiple spectral samples, so we may be able to come up
with a fairly complete set of environments if everyone pitches in.

Subject: Extension of sky luminance functions?
Status: R

Hi there.  Does anyone have or know of a continuous
extension to the CIE standard luminance functions (for
clear and overcast skies) to account for reflection from
the ground?

I've been using these functions to model ambient light in
radiosity solutions and cloud rendering.  The discontinuity
produced by a reflected fraction of this function to
account for ground reflection produces unwanted
discontinuities in my shading. While this is not so
noticeable in a radiosity solution, raytracing highlights
the inefficiencies of such a system.

is built for image processing, but perhaps it could have some
application to image synthesis. 
I could spend some time looking into its use  unless
somebody else has already done a lot of work in this area.

2. Last Siggraph Dan Baum had a video showing a progressive
refinement radiosity solution in progress, with the shooting
patches highlighted. What other videos illustrating global
illumination principles are around? Are any of them available
for purchase?

3)  People with whom I've exchanges papers before
4)  People who work at places I'm planning to apply

You fall into category 4.  Last fall I did not have much time for

Hi A.T.,

I'm flattered that you would want to work here at LBL, but the hiring
situation is pretty bad right now.  The funding for my work has never

may be the last that we have any money for lighting simulation, period.

I'll let you know if my situation here takes a turn for the better, but

Greg,

My mental images of National Laboratories is being completely blown.  For
the past several years, I have seen lots of good work coming out of
National Labs (Lawrence Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley, Sandia), so I assumed
that they must be great places to work.  At SIGGRAPH I asked Nelson Max
about the hiring situation at Livermore;  he said that it was not good, but
suggested that I contact your group.  With your status report, I wonder if
I should bother at any of the other National Labs?

I had already decided to try the other places you mentioned.  Thanks for
the suggestions, though.  If any place else comes to mind, please let me
know.

Don't worry about the charge for the dissertation.  You actually seem
interested in reading it, which is enough reward for me.

I'll keep you posted with further developments.

A. T.

Does anyone have any experience with ElectroGIG?  I can't really
argue with the price, but if the software's no good, there's not

closest intersection distance on".

-----

p. 37, line 8 of text:  change "If no such point exists" to "If no such root
exists".

-----

p. 38, in the Example, after "First normalize":  a right bracket ("]") is
missing on the line beginning with "Rd = [".

-----

p. 52, equation (C9):  change "(in other words, if Vd > 0)" to "(in other
words, if Vd < 0)".

-----

p. 58, Figure 8:  change the axes' labels from "X" and "Y" to "U" and "V".

-----

p. 60, third equation in (E2):  change "Nd" to "Na".

-----

p. 62, first line after equation (E11):  change "substituting v for u" to
"substituting v for u and substituting Nb for Nc".

-----

p. 66, lines 7 and 8 of algorithm:  change "if t1 > tnear, set t1 = tnear" to
"if t1 > tnear, set tnear = t1".  Change "if t2 < tfar, set t2 = tfar" to
"if t2 < tfar, set tfar = t2".

-----

p. 69, first line after equation (G5):  change "can be factored out" to "can
be deleted".

-----

p. 70, lower right corner of matrix in (G2):  change "315" to "-315".

-----

p. 70, halfway down page, on down:  the calculations for t0 and t1 are shown
incorrectly.  First, the leading "(" sign in each calculation should be
deleted.  More importantly, the term "-(-3.46)" should also appear over the
denominator "2*4.67".  The answers are correct.  To summarize:

	      -(-3.46) - sqrt( SAME AS BEFORE )
	t0 = -----------------------------------
			2 * 4.67

	   = -10.3

and:

	      -(-3.46) + sqrt( SAME AS BEFORE )
	t1 = -----------------------------------
			2 * 4.67

	   = 11.1

-----

p. 70, last line:  change "t0 is positive" to "t1 is positive".

the the intersections of the ray with all the objects in the CSG tree are
required" to end as "may be required".

-----

p. 88, equation "t = etc":  change from "t = etc" to "t = -etc", i.e. a minus
sign is missing, so negate the right hand side of the equation.

-----

p. 91, last formula in the Sphere section (in the text):  change to

	x1^2 + y1^2 + z1^2 = 1
		^
		subscript was "0"

-----

p. 91, in the Paraboloid section, second equation:  change the two minus signs
to plus signs (i.e. before z1 and z0).

-----

p. 93, torus equation corrections:  change two equations

        a2 = 2(x1^2+y1^2+z1^2)((x0^2+y0^2+z0^2)-(a^2+b^2))

p. 95, last formula on the page:  change to
	
	z(u,v) = h y(v)
		   ^
		   subscript was "x"

-----

p. 100, Figure 7 is wrong.

The upper figure is in error; the lower part is correct.  In the upper figure,
the outer contour is the silhouette of a 3D parametric surface.  Curve c1 is
the intersection of one plane with that surface, and c2 is the intersection of
another plane, perpendicular to the first.  The line of intersection of the
two planes is collinear with the ray, indicated by the line with the arrow.
The other three lines in the figure are extraneous and should be ignored.  The
lower part of the figure shows the two curves in uv space.

-----

p. 101, the last sentence in the Bicubic Patches section:  change "this can
involve a loss of extra computation" should be "this can involve extra
computation".

-----

p. 101, the second equation in the Numerical Methods section:  change the
second "=" in the line to a "+" (it's the only equation with two "=" in it).

-----

p. 105, the 2-D line equation:  change to

	(y1)x - (x1)y - (x0y1 - y0x1) = 0
		      ^
		      was a "+"

-----

p. 108, formula for f:  This does not agree with Fig. 10.  Using the same
notation as in the figure, change to:

-----

p. 158, line immediately after Fdt(lambda) definition:  change "We note that
the diffuse reflectance" to "diffuse transmittance".

-----

p. 238, Fig. 24:  A chunk is missing in the upper left corner.  The labels
should read:  "Directions crossed with", and "Applies to".

-----

p. 260, reference by Gervautz:  change "Comput. Graph." to "Computers and
Graphics".

-----

p. 288, immediately after the DERIVATION OF REFRACTION FORMULAS header:  The
introductory paragraph is missing.  It reads:

We derive three alternative formulas for the refracted ray direction in ray
tracing in order to prove their equivalence and to demonstrate the process of
translating physical laws into optimized computational formulas.

It is common knowledge that light rays refract when they strike an interface
between two different transparent media, such as air-water, air-glass, or
glass-water.  In 1621 Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snell discovered a
formula quantifying this observation:  the ratio of the sines of the incident
and refracted angles equals the ratio of the indices of refraction of the two
materials.  Snell's law is:

	eta  sin( theta  ) = eta  sin( theta  )
	   1           1        2           2

where theta-sub-1 is the angle of incidence, theta-sub-2 is the angle of
refraction (both measured from the perpendicular to the interface) and
eta-sub-1 and eta-sub-2 are the two indices of refraction on the incident and
refracted sides of the interface, respectively.

Light passing through a material slows relative to its speed in a vacuum by a
factor equal to the index of refraction of that material.  In fact, Snell's
law is a simple consequence of this speed variation and Fermat's _Principle of
Least Time_, which states that light takes the fastest path to get from one
point to another [Feynman63].

For computation we need to recast Snell's law in terms of (x,y,z) direction
vectors.  This can be done in several different ways.  In the derivations
below we make extensive use of angles and trigonometry, but thankfully, it is
possible to eliminate all of these terms from the final formulas, so
theta-sub-1 and theta-sub-2 need never be computed.  As a convention, vectors
are upper case and scalars are lower case.

Subject: Is Image Synthesis a Solved Problem?
Status: RO

Dear Globillumnus,

I will be delivering an invited talk at the Eurographics workshop on Rendering
in Bristol next month. I look forward to seeing some of you there.  

The title of the talk is "Is Image Synthesis a Solved Problem?". My intention
is to use this forum to bring up a number of questions and issues which I feel
have been addressed well and not so well in the field. Hopefully, it might
also address a perception in the industry that a lot of research resources are
misdirected towards image synthesis work. Nick Negroponte opened the recent
Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics with the description of the field of
computer graphics as just emerging from the "dark ages" (1975-1990) in which
much of the efforts were (mis)spent on realistic imaging.

Anyway, since this is a topic dear to us all, rather than write a personal
treatise on the topic, I want all of you to pitch in with your two cents
worth. So, before you go on to your next mail message, take 3 minutes to
repond to this totally unscientific survey. (If you can't see the bottom of
this message from here, don't fear. There are only 5 or 6 questions).

0. How would you define the goal of image synthesis?



I. What are the key issues that are still unanswered or not answered well in
realistic image synthesis? Rate each issue as unsolved (0) to solved (5).

                                                 Unsolved              Solved
                                                   0    1    2    3    4    5
(a) local reflection models
(b) the hidden surface problem
(c) rendering caustics
(d) dealing with environment complexity
(e) mapping results to display devices
(f) parallelization of image synthesis algorithms
(g) dealing with color
(h) dealing human perceptual issues
(i) other (please specify)

(j) and another?



II. Many people in the graphics think that the MAIN problem remaining in
image synthesis is simply that we cannot model, with sufficient detail,
the environments we want to create images of. Do you agree?

                                                 Disagree              Agree
                                                   0    1    2    3    4    5


III. Overall, how far do YOU think we have come in solving the image synthesis
problem. If 0 means we have not even scratched the surface, to 5 meaning
the problem is all but solved, 

                                                 Unsolved              Solved
                                                   0    1    2    3    4    5  


IV. Overall, how do you think the computer graphics field AS A WHOLE views the
progress of solving the image synthesis problem?  Again, if 0 means we have
not even scratched the surface, and 5 meaning the problem is all but solved,

                                                 Unsolved              Solved
                                                   0    1    2    3    4    5


V. Thanks for the responses so far. Any additional comments would be welcome,
e.g., how should the field change its focus (if in fact you think it should)?

Your chance to add some comment:



VI. May I quote you?      YES         NO


-------------------

Thanks. I'll see some of you in England, and will send you all the results.

-Michael

Hi Michael,

Here are my responses to your survey questions:

0.  I would define the goal of image synthesis as the accurate
	calculation of a 2-dimensional map of radiance values
	from a computer model of a physical environment.

I.  How solved are the following, where 0 is Unsolved and 5 is Solved?

	a) local reflection models:		1
	b) the hidden surface problem:		4
	c) rendering caustics:			1
	d) dealing with environment compl.:	1
	e) mapping results to displays:		2
	f) parallelization of image..:		1
	g) dealing with color:			1
	h) dealing with humans:			0
	i) dealing with daylight:		2
	j) animation (walk-through) accuracy:	1

II.  I agree that we cannot model in sufficient detail, but we haven't
	the algorithms to deal with complex cases even if we could.  3.

III.  Overall, I would say were somewhere between 1 and 2, probably closer
	to a 1.

IV.  I can only guess what the rest of the graphics community thinks.  Maybe
	a 3 or 4?

V.  I think we should place more emphasis on combining local and global
	illumination models, a la Sillion's work (although I favor Monte
	Carlo methods).  Also, I think that current meshing strategies
	are woefully inadequate.  I would like to see more attention
	paid to meshing for accuracy, or doing away with meshing altogether.

VI.  Yes, quote away.  Just don't reproduce my typso.

Have fun in England.  Wish I were going!

Subject: Gouraud shading
Status: RO


All @ globillum:

I've got this problem (more a query really) with Gouraud shading - I sent the
following message to comp.graphics.research 9 days ago and it still hasn't
appeared here, so I thought I'd give globillum a spin:

=============================================================================

I wonder if anyone out there could help/empathise/sympathise[ :-( ] with this
problem I've been having for over a year now:

I'm trying to render pictures generated using radiosity algorithms, but when I
do adaptive subdivision, I end up with (say) a quadrilateral with N (>4) points
along its border whose RGB values I know, and I want to Gouraud shade across
the polygon.

Now I know that Gouraud shading is only well-defined for triangles, but the
software I was using (DEC PHIGS v2.2 running on VMS v5.4) was confident about
smooth shading over as many vertices as I cared to choose, so I plugged in the
data (see end of file) and ended up with *really* sharp lines along the edge
which has multiple RGB values.  I know this is *not* Mach banding (well, its
not _expected_ Mach banding) - Mach banding is what I expect if I try and
Gouraud shade quadrilaterals - this is an error in the shading algorithm.

So, I thought "******* DEC - I'll try it on Sun PHIGS" (don't know version)
and got *exactly* the same error.  Now we've just got a shiny new
HP 9000/720 CRX 24Z - running StarBase - and I get the exactly the same error
again with the same data.

Now, I know that I can get around the problem by not trying to render a
quadrilateral which has >4 points across which I want smooth shading, but my
question is this:

	o  Does your rendering software do the same thing with this data ?

	o  Why ???

ANY help/suggestions/ideas much appreciated.

Here's the data - its format is:
	int				/* no of polygons */

	int                             /* no of verts to be shaded across */
	float	float	float           /* X Y Z of 1st point of 1st poly */
	float	float	float	    	/* R G B of 1st point of 1st poly */
	..
	..
	float	float	float           /* X Y Z of last point of 1st poly */
	float	float	float	    	/* R G B of last point of 1st poly */

	<... rest of polygons ... >

As shown here, its three squares, lying in the plane y=20, two small ones
with 4 vertices to be shaded across (CEHG, EFIH) and one big one with 5
vertices to be shaded across (ABFEC).  I get an *awful* sharp line along CF.

	A ----------- B
	  |         |
	  |         |
	  |         |
	  |    E    |
	C ----------- F
	  |    |    |
	  |    |    |
	G ----------- I
	       H

Try re-arranging the data so that you render a triangle (AEC) and a
quadrilateral (ABFE) instead of ABFEC - this makes the problem vanish; but why
is it there in the first place ?????

Thanks in advance.

        Reply to:   RE>Gouraud shading
The scanline directly above CF is obtained by interpolating colors from edge AC
and BF. CF is interpolated with colors from CEF. That's why you see
discontinuity along CF. If the polygons are rotated in some degree, say 45, or
CEF is not colinear, the discontinuity may be less obvious. The right solution
is to avoid T-vertices in Gouraud shading. Hope this help.

Hello from sunny Bristol, UK, where the Third Eurographics rendering workshop
is just beginning!

Alan Chalmers has printed up about 50 extra copies of the proceedings
of this workshop which you can order by sending him 25 pounds sterling
in cash (if you dare) or email him your VISA card account number,
expiration date, and name.
The proceedings are paperback, about 200 pages total, with color
figures, containing 20 papers.  They will be available either as a
Springer-Verlag book or as a Eurographics technical report at
some date in the future (maybe a year?) but if you want a copy soon,
this is your best bet.

To all,

	After SIGGRAPH is the time of the year in which I start seriously
gathering new references for the "radiosity" bibliography (it should be called
the "global illumination except for purely classical ray-tracing" bibliography,
but that was a bit long).

	What follows are the new references I've gathered so far (I still have
to include SIGGRAPH '92 and Graphics Interface '92 references, and the 3rd
Eurographics Workshop on Rendering is added but not included below in the
interests of brevity).  If you have anything to add, correct, etc, please do
let me know.  I also appreciate the full names of people (e.g. Eihachiro
Nakamae instead of E. Nakamae), so please pass these on.

	As soon as the Eurographics '92 proceedings references have been
entered into this database I'll announce the release of the latest
bibliography.

	In case you don't know, the current bibliography is available for FTP
as princeton.edu:/pub/Graphics/Papers/RadBib.09.91

Thanks,

Eric Haines  erich@eye.com

Paul & Greg,

	I'm not sure which of you is maintaining the re-mailer nowadays, so
this note's to both of you.  Is there any way to have the globillum mailer not
send me every bounce from all the naughty email addresses that don't want to
receive my pearls of wisdom?  After my two postings on radiosity references
I've been getting a trickle of "blabhable.goomble.edu has not received your
message during the past 4 days, 3 minutes, 2 seconds...".  I've deleted about
15 of these so far, and I was wondering if you can turn these off (i.e. not
have me receive bounces) from your end of things.  I know it's possible, since
I never get this behavior with other mailing lists I'm involved in, but
haven't a clue what to do.  If it's easy, please do do it.

Thanks,

Eric Haines

Hi --

Since there has been a lot of discussion about standard
terminology in this group, and since I work at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), I have
gotten a lot of requests about standards. I thought I would
try to clear up what the deal is on who makes up standards, and
then try to start up the terminology discussion again. 

The following is just an informal description, and I'm
not writing in any official capacity.

Anyway, NIST (formerly the NBS) is a government laboratory which
is part of the United States Department of Commerce. It has
historically been a lab for measurement technology and research
on standards. More recently, with the name change, NIST has
a broader purpose now, which is to generally assist industry
in the development of technology. NIST does offer calibration
services, standard reference materials, etc., but doesn't
define or enforce standards.

An organization that does coordinate voluntary standards in the
US is ANSI (American National Standards Institute). ANSI
is a private sector federation of many different organizations.
ANSI is the US member of many international standards bodies.

What does this have to do with global illumination? In the
past discussion of terminology in this group Pete Shirley and
others have pointed out that there is an ANSI/IES (Illuminating
Engineering Society) standard  "ANSI/IES RP-16-1986,
Nomenclature and Definitions for Illuminating Engineering."
The standard defines terms such as luminance,luminous intensity,
units such as the candela and various types of reflectance. It
also covers some information about color, lighting calculations,
and television, film and theatre light. It also has some CIE
data. It would seem like a good idea for us to use as much
of the terminology from this standard as possible.

So how do you get RP-16-1986? NIST can't distribute it, because
we don't have the copyright. You can call the IES for a
publications catalog (212)705-7920. Or you can contact ANSI
(Sales department phone number (212)642-4900, address
1430 Broadway, New York, NY 10018). The ANSI catalog recommends
that outside of the US you contact the standards organization
in your country, or one of these ANSI sales agents:

American Technical Publishers, Ltd.
68a Wilbury Way
Hitch, Herts SG40TP
England

Japanese Standards Association
1-24 Akasaka 4-Chrome
Minato-Ku 
Tokyo 107, Japan

Standards Council of Canada
350 Sparks, Suite 1200
Ottawa K1P 6N7, Ontario, Canada

The standard is about 60+ pages long, and lists for $39.00
in the catalog I looked at.

So, all that being said, I was planning next week to try
to summarize the terms from the standard that I think apply
to image generation, and the questions that remain
unresolved (e.g. rough specular vs. imperfect diffuse vs. ???).
If anybody else has already compiled a digested version of
the standard for computer graphics, please feel free to
jump in and post it.

Section 2. Electromagnetic Radiation

2.1 Radiant Energy, Q. Energy traveling in the form
of electromagnetic waves. It is measured in units
of energy such as joules or kilowatt hours.

  2.1.1 Spectral radiant energy, Q(subscript-Greek-lambda)...
   Radiant energy per unit wavelength interval;...

2.2 Photon. A quantum of radiant energy ...

...

2.4 Radiant flux (radiant power), (capital-Greek-phi) = dQ/dt.
The time rate of flow of energy...

   2.4.1 Spectral radiant flux (capital-Greek-phi)(subscript-
Greek-lambda) = d( capital-Greek-phi)/d(Greek-lambda)...

2.5 Radiant flux areal density, d(capital-Greek-phi)/dA,
(at a point on a surface). The quotient of the radiant
flux incident on or emitted by an element of surface area at
the point, by the area of the element. Radiant flux density
emitted from a surface has been called emittance. (footnote --
"To be deprecated."). The preferred term for radiant flux
density leaving a surface is exitance, (M). Radiant flux
density incident on a surface is irradiance, (E).

   2.5.1 (spectral exitance and irradiance) ...

2.6 Radiant intensity, I = d(capital-Greek-phi)/d(small-Greek-omega)
(in a given direction). The radiant flux proceeding from a source
per unit solid angle in the given direction...

   2.6.1 (spectral radiant intensity)

2.7 Radiance,
 L = d(second partial) (capital-Greek-phi)/[d(omega)dA cos(theta)] 
   = dI/[dA cos(theta)] (in a given direction at a point on
the surface of a source, of a receiver, or of any other real
or virtual surface). The quotient of the radiant flux leaving,
passing through, or arriving at an element of the surface surrounding
the point, and propagated in directions defined by an elementary
cone containing the given direction, by the product of the solid
angle of the cone and the area of the orthogonal projection of
the element of the surface on a plane perpendicular to the given
direction.

   Note: In the defining equation (theta) is the angle between
the normal to the surface and the given direction.

--- (I have never heard, much less used these 
    terms before myself, but I think the radiant

unit volume ...

...

2.8 Radiant fluence , F[(capital-Greek-delta)t], (for
a time interval (capital-Greek-delta)t, at a point in
space). The omnidirectional radiant energy externally
incident on an elementary sphere about the point, per unit 
cross-sectional area of the sphere.

 F[(capital-Greek-delta)t] = dQ/da 
          |= integral over (capital-Greek-delta)t
               integral over 4 (Greek-pi) steradians
                           L d(Greek-omega) dt|

where da is the cross-sectional area of the sphere.

   2.8.1 (spectral radiant fluence).

2.9 Radiant fluence rate, F(subscript-t) (at a point in 
space). The omnidirectional radiant flux externally incident
on an elementary sphere, per unit cross sectional unit of 
the sphere. ...
    
    2.9.1 (spectral fluence rate).

2.10 Radiant sterisent, L*(x), (at a point along a ray path).
Rate of increase in radiance, per unit path length, at the point
in the direction of the ray, due to "generated" (emitted or
scattered) radiance, or the "generated" radiant intensity
per unit volume, at the point and in the direction of the ray, 
by which a distributed source can be characterized. 
L* = dL(subscript-g)/dx = dI(subscript-g)/dV, where dx is an
element of distance along the ray path, dV is an element of volume
at the point, and the subscript g denotes a "generated" quantity.

   Note: This quantity is useful in dealing with radiative transfer
through a region where significant emission or scattering 
into the ray, as well as attenuation by absorption or scattering
out of the ray, occurs along a ray path; also for evaluating
the intensity of an extended volume of emitting and partially
transmitting (transparent) material. ...

   2.10.1 (spectral radiant sterisent).

-- I think that since we do wavelength by wavelength
calculations for image synthesis, the quantities for describing
electromagnetic radiation in Section 2 that I posted last
time are the most applicable. However, for the purpose
of reading the illumination literature the following definitions
are useful. --

-- Also I think it is important to separate three basic terms,
radiance, for quantity of electromagnetic radiation (measurable
by a meter), luminance, for "light" as defined below (also
measurable by a meter), and brightness for the sensation
produced by the incident electromagnetic radiation. ---

Section 3. Light *
(* Symbols for radiometric terms are indentified by the
subscript e, and those for photometric (luminous) terms
by the subscript v. In the event that no confusion will occur, 
the subscripts may be omitted...)

3.1 Light. Radiant energy that is capable of exciting the
retina and producing a visual sensation. The visible portion
of the electro magnetic spectrum extends from about 380 to
770 nanometers.

 Note: The subjective impression produced by stimulating
the retina is sometimes designated as light. Visual sensations
are sometimes arbitrarily defined as sensations of light, and in 
line with this concept it is sometimes said that light
cannot exist until an eye has been stimulated . Electrical
stimulation of the retina or the visual cortex is described
as producing flashes of light. In illuminating engineering,
however, light is a physical entity -- radiant energy
weighted by the luminous efficiency function ... It is
a physical stimulus that can be applied to the retina.

	3.1.1 Phot-. Combining form meaning, broadly, within
the visible spectrum.

3.2 Luminous flux  (capital-Greek-phi). Radiant flux (radiant
power); the time rate of flow of radiant energy, evaluated
in terms of a standardized visual response.

(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript v) = 
K(subscript m) * integral over all wavelengths (Greek lambda)
     {(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript e, Greek lambda) *
              V(Greek lambda)} d (Greek-lambda)

where
	(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript v) = lumens
(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript e, Greek lambda) = watts per nanometer
		lambda = nanometers
	V(Greek lambda)= the spectral luminous efficiency
	K(subscript m) = the maximum spectral luminous
                          efficiency in lm/W

Unless otherwise indicated, the luminous flux is defined for
photopic vision. For scotopic vision, V'(Greek lambda) and
the corresponding maximum spectral luminous efficacy K'(subscript m)
are substituted in the above equation. K(subscript m) and 
K'(subscript m) are derived fromt the basic SI definition of
luminous intensity and have the values 683 lm/W and
1754 lm/W respectively ...

       3.2.1 Lumen, lm. SI unit of luminous flux. Radiometrically,
it is determined from the radiant power as in Paragraph 3.2. 
Photometrically, it is the luminous flux emitted within a unit 
solid angle (one steradian) by a point source having a uniform
luminous intensity of one candela.

3.3 Luminous flux density at a surface, d(capital-Greek-phi)/dA
The luminous flux per unit area at a point on a surfaces ...

   3.3.1 Illuminance E = d(capital-Greek-phi)/dA. The areal
densiy of the luminous flux incident at a point on a surface

      3.3.1.1 Illumination. An alternative, but deprecated,
term for illuminance...

      3.3.1.2 Lux, lx. The SI unit of illuminance. One lux is
one lumen per square meter (lm/m**2)...

      3.3.1.3 Footcandle, fc. A unit of illuminance. One footcandle
is one lumen per square foot (lm/ft**2).

      3.3.1.4 Phot, ph. A unit of illuminance euqal to one lumen 
per square centimeter. The use of this unit is deprecated.

   3.3.2 Luminous exitance, M = d(capital-Greek-phi)/dA. The
areal density of luminous flux leaving a surface at a point. 
Formerly, luminous emittance (deprecated).
    Note: This is the total luminance flux emitted, reflected
and transmitted from the surface and is independent of direction.
   ...

3.4 Luminous intensity I = d(capital-Greek-phi)/d(Greek-small-omega)
(of a point source of light in a given direction). The luminous
flux per unit solid angle in the direction in question ...
Luminous intensity may be expressed in candelas or in lumens
per steradian (lm/sr).

   3.4.1 Candela, cd. The SI unit of luminous intensity. One
candela is one lumen per steradian (lm/sr). Formerly, candle.

  Note: The fundamental luminous intensity defineion in the SI is 
the candela. The candela is the luminous intensity, in
a given direciton of a source that emits monochromatic radiaiton
of frequency 540*10(raised to 12th power) hertz that has
a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.
... 
   3.4.2 Candlepower, cp. Luminous intensity expressed in 
candelas.

   3.4.3 Equivalent luminous intensity of an extended source
at a specified distance. The intensity of a a point source
that would produce the same illuminance at that distance ...

...

3.5 Luminance,
L = d(second-derivative)(capital-Greek-phi)/d(Greek-omega)dA cos(theta)
(in a direction and at a point on a real or imaginary surface).
... The quotient of the luminous flux at an element of the surface
surrounding the point, and propagated in directions defined
by an elementary cone containing the given direction, by
the product of the solide angle of the cone and the area of the 
orthogonal projection of the element of the surface on a 
plan perpendicular to the given direction. The luminous flux
may be leaving, passing through, and/or arriving ath the surface.
...

   Note: In common usage the term brightness usually refers to the
strength of sensation that results from viewing surfaces or spaces
from which light comes to the eye. This sensation is determined
in part by the definitely measurable luminance defined above
 and in part by the conditions of observations such as the state
of adaptation of the eye...

	3.5.1 SI unit of luminance. Candela per square meter
(cd/m**2); also lumen per steradian * square meter (lm/(sr*m**2).
This is also called the nit.

 ...(continues with a lot of older units for luminance) ..
 ...(also definitions for luminous fluence & sterisent)
 ...

     3.10.4 Luminous efficacy of radiant flux. The quotient
of the total luminous flux by the total radiant flux. It
is expressed in lm/W.

3.11 Luminous efficacy of a source of light. The quotient
of the total luminous flux emitted by the total lamp power
input. It is expressed in lm/W.

Holly's posts have gotten me thinking again that I want a device to
measure luminance or something similar (spectral radiance through
the visible spectrum would be best :^}) at a particular point in a
particular direction.  At the photography store, I found a device called
a spot-meter that measures something (luminance-like quantity with a film
response curve?) withing a one degree diamether cone.  This cost about
$350.  What other devices are there?  What do they cost?  Anyone have
any comments on their reliability?

PS-- If you do get hold of the ANSI doc that Holly's been digesting for
us (thanks Holly!), the definition for luminance is a lot easier to
read than the much briefer definition for radiance,  so you might get
more out of the luminance definition (and the geometrical part is the same!).

For the infamous original Cornell box experiment, I used a 
Tektronix J16 photometer. It had two different probes for 
measuring illuminance and irradiance. We didn't buy it for
the experiment -- the lab had it for calibrating monitors.
The directional sensitivity of the probe is plotted in the
paper. I used it as a directional device for measuring light
source radiance by taping a cardboard tube on.

Here at NIST the Lighting group has a luminance mapper -- basically
a digital camera that gives an accurate luminance at each
pixel. In October (beginning of our fiscal year) we're
planning to start a project to measure some simple scenes to
develop some reference data sets for people to compare against
calculations. My idea is to post and/or make available some
initial results after a couple of months and get feed 
back from you all about how useful the data is.

P.S. on a separate subject -- could people who attended 
Eurographics post a summary of global illumination related
stuff that was presented/discussed?

Summary of applicable definitions from
ANSI/IES RP-16-1986 "Nomenclature and
Definitions for Illuminating Engineering"

______________ my comments __________________________________

Sections 4, 5 and 6 contain a lot of interesting information,
but don't deal with definitions we have problems with. Section
4 covers "Color" and defines things such as the Munsell hue,
value and chroma, the color temperature of lights, color
matching functions, metamers, and the standard illuminants
A,B,C and variations of D.  Section 5 covers "Visual Terms"
and defines things such as photopic, mesopic, and scotopic vision,
the Purkinje phenomenon, Broca-Sulzer effect, flicker, glare, 
visual comfort probability (VCP)  and the Stiles-Crawford
effect. Section 6 covers "Light Sources" and defines all
sorts of lamps and lamp terms including various incandescent lamps, 
electric-discharge lamps, laser and LED.

One the other hand, Section 7 contains a lot of definitions
relevant to surface properties that we are concerned with. It
will take a few of messages to cover all the stuff in 7.

The following covers specular/diffuse. The way I read it,
specular reflection is only in the mirror direction and
is preferably referred to as regular reflection. 
Diffuse is a general term and refers to reflection in any other
direction. There are three potential modifiers for diffuse --
"perfect" (= lambertian), "narrow-angle" and "wide-angle".

____________________ begin summary of standard _____________


Section 7. Surfaces and Media for Light Control

7.1 Diffusing surfaces and media. Those surfaces and media that
redistribute at least some of the incident flux by scattering.
  
    7.1.1 Perfect diffusion. That in which flux is uniformly
scattered in accord with Lambert's cosine law (see Paragraph
7.1.1.1)
       
        7.1.1.1 Lambert's cosine law 
(I(subscript-Greek-theta) = I(subscript o) cos (Greek-theta)) 
The law stating that the luminous intensity in any direction
from an element of a perfectly diffusing surface varies as
the cosine of the angle between that direction and the
perpendicular to the surface element.

	7.1.1.2 Lambertian surface. A surface that emits or
reflects light in accordance with Lambert's cosine law. A
lambertian surface has the same luminance regardless of 
viewing angle.
    
    7.1.2 Complete diffusion. That in which the diffusing medium
completely redirects the incident flux by scattering, i.e., no
incident flux can remain in an image-forming state.
    
    7.1.3 Incomplete diffusion(partial diffusion). That in which
the diffusing medium partially redirects the incident flux by
scattering while the remaining fraction of incident flux is
redirected without scattering, i.e., a fraction of the incident
flux can remain in an image-forming state.

    7.1.4 Wide-angle diffusion. That in which flux is scattered 
at angles far from the direction which the flux would take by 
regular reflection (se Paragraph 7.3.1) or transmission.

    7.1.5 Narrow-angle diffusion. That in which flux is scattered
at angles near the direction which the flux would take by
regular reflection or transmission.

7.2 Redirecting surfaces and media. Those which change the direction
of the flux without scattering the redirected flux.

7.3 Reflection. A general term for the process by which the incident
flux leaves a (stationary) surface or medium from the incident
side, without change in frequency.

    Note: Reflection is usually a combination of regular and
diffuse reflection (see Paragraphs 7.3.1 and 7.3.2).

    7.3.1 Regular (specular) reflection. That process by which
incident flux is redirected at the specular angle ...

      7.3.1.1 Specular angle. That angle between the perpendicular
to the surface and the reflected ray that is numerically
equal to the angle of incidence, and that lies in the same
plane as the incident ray and the perpendicular, but on the
opposite side.

    7.3.2 Diffuse reflection. That process by which incident
flux is redirected over a rage (sic) of angles (see also
Paragraph 7.1)

Hello Dr Holly_Rushmeier,

Thank you very much for your efforts in  educating us with the

I am wondering if V(Greek lambda) is the relative spectral

K(subscript m) multiplier should not occur in the above
equation.

I just want to make sure that the Luminous efficacy of a

the output power.

Further can efficacy and efficiency be used interchangeably ?

--I just want to make sure that the Luminous efficacy of a

Paragraph 3.11 does say that the denominator is the total
lamp power INPUT. My interpretation of the significance of this
is that it takes into account losses to convection and conduction
(i.e. when you plug in a lamp its temperature is increased and
some energy leaves the lamp by mechanisms other than radiation) 
as well as radiation outside of the visible band. (Please 
someone correct me if this is not the point of this definition .)

--Further can efficacy and efficiency be used interchangeably ?

My impression of the standard is that a differentiation
is made between efficacy and efficiency. Efficacy measures
how effectively light is produced from energy input in absolute
terms, and therefore has units (lumens/watt) and is not limited
in value to the range 0 to 1. Efficiency measures how effectively
light is produced relative to a standard -- i.e., "efficiency"
is inherently relative. Efficiency is dimensionless and
is limited to the range 0 to 1. 

I did ask one of the people here who works in lighting research,
and this apparently is the way the terms are commonly used these
days. Just to confuse things however, there is a note in the
standard just after paragraph 3.11 saying that the term luminous
efficiency has been used extensively in the past for the concept
defined in 3.11 as luminous efficacy.

______________ my comments __________________________________

On the subject of reflectance, the standard carefully differentiates
between the term "reflectance" which is non-dimensional
quantity ranging from zero to one and is denoted by a Greek
rho, and the term "reflectance distribution function" which
has units, of a sort (one over steradian), may take
on any postive value, and which is denoted by f. Although I 
haven't used this terminology and notation myself in the past,
after reading the standard, Pat Hanrahan's intro. to the
Radiosity notes, and some recent Siggraph papers, I think 
it would be worthwhile to make these distinctions in the future.
In particular I think that using an f in place of a rho
for BRDF would make it easier for people to accept that it
can take on values greater than one.

____________________ begin summary of standard _____________

7.3.3 Reflectance, (Greek-rho) = (capital-Greek-phi)(subscript-r)/
(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript-i)  (of a surface or medium).
The ratio of the reflected flux to the incident flux. Reflectance
is a function of:

    (1) Geometry:
        (a) of the incident flux;
        (b) of collection for the reflected flux.
    (2) Spectral distribution:
        (a) characteristic of the incident flux;
        (b) weighting function for the collected flux.
    (3) Polarization:
        (a) of the incident flux;
        (b) component defined for the collected flux.

Notes:
  (i) Unless the state of polarization for the incident flux and
the polarized component of the reflected flux are stated, it
shall be considered that the incident flux is unpolarized and that
the total reflected flux (including all polarizations) is evaluated.
  (ii) Spectral reflectance depends only on the beam geometry
and the character of the reflecting surface (and on polarization).
Luminous reflectance also is a function of the spectral distribution
of the incident flux.
  (iii) If no qualifying geometric adjective is used, reflectance
for hemispherical collection is meant...
  (iv) Certain of the reflectance terms are theoretically imperfect
and are recognized only as practical concepts to be used
when applicable Physical measurements of the incident and reflected
flux are always biconical in nature. Directional reflectances...
cannot exist since one component is finite while the other
is infinitesimal; here the reflectance-distribution function
(see Paragraph 7.3.3.17) is required. However, the concepts 
directional and hemispherical reflectances have practical
application in instrumentation, measurements, and calculations
when including the aspect of the nearly zero or nearly 2(Greek-pi)
conical angle would increase complexity without appreciably
affecting the immediate results.
   (v) In each case of conical incidence or collection, the solid
angle is not restricted to a right cone, but may be of
any cross section including rectangular, ring, or a combination
of two or more solid angles.
   ...

   7.3.3.1-7.3.3.10 (Definitions of Bihemispherical, 
Hemispherical-conical, hemispherical-directional, 
conical-hemispherical, biconical, conical-directional, 
directional-hemispherical, directional-conical, bidirectional
and hemispherical reflectances. All of these are defined as
the ratio of reflected to incident flux. Hemispherical refers
to flux in all directions, conical refers to flux within a 
specified cone, and directional refers to a specific direction.
For directional quantities, the incident flux is collimated, and
for reflected flux the size of the solid angle of the collecting
element must be specified). 

7.3.3.11 Regular(specular) reflectance. The ratio of all the 
flux leaving a surface or medium by regular(specular) reflection
to the incident flux.

7.3.3.12 Diffuse reflectance. The ratio of the flux leaving
a surface or medium by diffuse reflection to the incident 
flux.
...
7.3.3.13 Spectral reflectance = (Greek-rho)(Greek-lambda) =
(capital-Greek-phi) (subscript r Greek-lambda) /
(capital-Greek-phi) (subscript i Greek-lambda).
The ratio of the reflected flux to the incident flux at a particular
wavelength Greek-lambda, or within a small band
of wavelengths (capital-Greek-delta Greek-lambda) about Greek
lambda.
...
7.3.3.17 Bidirectional reflectance-distribution function (BRDF),
f(subscript r), The ratio of the differential luminance of
a ray dL(subscript r)(Greek-theta subscript r, Greek-phi subscript r)
reflected in a given direction (Greek-theta subscript r,
Greek-phi subscript r) to the differential luminous flux density
dE(subscript i)(Greek-theta subscript i, Greek-phi subscript i)
incident from a given direction of incidence (Greek-theta subscript i,
 Greek-phi subscript i) that produces it ...

   Notes: 
     (i) This distribution function is the basic parameter
for describing (geometrically) the reflecting properties
of an opaque surface element (negligible internal scattering).
     (ii) It may have any positive value and will
approach infinity in the specular direction for ideally
specular reflectors.
     (iii) The spectral and polarization aspects must be 
defined for complete specification, since the BRDF as given
above only defines the geometric aspects.

(7.3.3.18 defines the reflectance factor R -- this compares
the reflected flux to the flux reflected by a perfect
surface -- I don't think this is useful in our application).

Hello Dr Holly_Rushmeier,

Thank U for clarifying my earlier doubts. A few more on the
RP-16-1986, Para. 7-3.

1) ----> 7.3.3 Reflectance, .......
   ----> .............
   ----> If no qualifying geometric adjective is used, reflectance
   ----> for hemispherical collection is meant
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Is "hemispherical collection" for both incoming and outgoing directions?

2) ----> 7.3.3.17 Bidirectional reflectance-distribution function(BRDF),.......
   ---->                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
The definition of BRDF  ideally makes it a density function.
I believe "Bidirectional reflectance-density function" makes
appropriate expansion for BRDF and confirms to its usage in MonteCarlo
sampling.
	(Note : In Monte Carlo sampling there is a distinction between
		density function,f(x), and distribution function,F(x),
		where f(x) = dF(x)/dx.)
As U are discussing standard nomencetures and definitions I thought it
will be appropriate to bring in this discussion here.
I solicit comments from you and other globilluminators on this point.

______________ my comments __________________________________

This message wraps up the end of section 7, and covers
transmission and absorption.

The standard refers to the BSSRDF, which is defined in
"Reference 20". Reference 20 is the NBS Monograph 160
by Nicodemus et al. cited in both the Radiosity and 
Global Illumination course notes at Siggraph. I'll explain
how to order 160 in a subsequent mail message.

I think the treatment of terminology in a participating
medium is inadequate. First, I think the coefficients should
be defined in terms of radiance, not flux. Second, I think
that the attenuation coefficient should be defined as the
sum of an absorption coefficient and a scattering coefficient --
recognizing that the quantity of energy travelling along
a path can be reduced either by absorption or out-scatter.

In response to Sumant's comments, I believe "collection"
implies outgoing directions. For example, if a "directional
reflectance" were reported, it should be inferred that it
is the flux reflected in all directions leaving the surface
divided by the flux incident from a particular direction.

Also in Sumant's comments, someone has finally suggested that
we should adopt a term that differs from the standard. In
general I think we  can/should be deviate  from the
standard in some instances, since computer graphics and 
illumination engineering are not identical fields. Is anyone
going to respond to Sumant's suggestion, either specifically
or in general?

7.4 Transmission. A general term for the process by which incident
flux leaves a surface or medium on a side other that (sic) the
incident side, without change in frequency.
   Note: Transmission through a medium is often a combination
of regular and diffuse transmission. ...

	7.4.1 Regular transmission. That process by which incident
flux passes through a surface or medium without scattering.

        7.4.2 Diffuse transmission. That process by which the 
incident flux passing through a surface or medium is scattered.

        7.4.3 Transmittance, (Greek-tau) = (capital-Greek-phi)(subscript-t)/
(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript-i)  (of a medium).
The ratio of the transmitted flux to the incident flux. It should
be noted that transmittance refers to the ratio of flux emerging
to flux incident; therefore, refections at the surface as well
as absorption within the material operate to reduce the 
transmittance.  Transmittance is a function of:

    (1) Geometry:
        (a) of the incident flux;
        (b) of collection for the transmitted flux.
    (2) Spectral distribution:
        (a) characteristic of the incident flux;
        (b) weighting function for the collected flux.
    (3) Polarization:
        (a) of the incident flux;
        (b) component defined for the collected flux.

Notes:
   ((i)-(iv) and (vi) basically the same notes as for reflectance)

    (v) These concepts must be applied with care, if the area
of the transmitting element is not large compared to its 
thickness, due to internal transmission across the boundary
of the area.
    ...
	
    (vii) The following breakdown of transmittance quantities
is applicable only to the transmittance of thin films with
negligible internal scattering so that the transmitted 
radiation emerges from a point that is not significantly separated
 from the point of incidence of the incident ray that produces the 
transmitted ray(s). The governing considerations are
similar to those for application for the bidirectional 
reflectance-distribution function (BRDF), rather than the
bidirectional scattering-surface reflectance-distribution
function (BSSRDF), as discussed in Reference 20. 
   ...

   7.4.3.1-7.4.3.9 and 7.4.3.11 (Definitions of Bihemispherical, 
Hemispherical-conical, hemispherical-directional, 
conical-hemispherical, biconical, conical-directional, 
directional-hemispherical, directional-conical, bidirectional
and hemispherical transmittances. All of these are defined as
the ratio of transmitted to incident flux. Hemispherical refers
to flux in all directions, conical refers to flux within a 
specified cone, and directional refers to a specific direction.
For directional quantities, the incident flux is collimated, and
for reflected flux the size of the solid angle of the collecting
element must be specified. 7.4.3.10 defines a luminous transmittance
as any of the other transmittances with the transmitted and
incident fluxes  weighted by the luminous efficiency 
V(Greek-lambda).) 

7.4.3.12 Regular transmittance. The ratio of the regularly
transmitted  flux leaving a surface or medium 
to the incident flux.

7.4.3.13 Diffuse transmittance. The ratio of the diffusely
transmitted flux leaving a surface or medium to the incident
flux.

...

7.4.3.14 Spectral transmittance = (Greek-tau)(Greek-lambda) =
(capital-Greek-phi) (subscript t Greek-lambda) /
(capital-Greek-phi) (subscript i Greek-lambda).
The ratio of the transmitted flux to the incident flux at a
particular wavelength Greek-lambda, or within a small band
of wavelengths (capital-Greek-delta Greek-lambda) about Greek
lambda.
...

7.4.3.15 Filter. A device for changing, by transmission or
reflection, the magnitude and/or the spectral composition
of the flux incident on it. Filters are called selective
(or colored) or neutral, according to whether or not they
alter the spectral distribution of the incident flux.

7.4.3.16 Bidirectional transmittance-distribution function (BTDF),
f(subscript t), The ratio of the differential luminance of
a ray dL(subscript t)(Greek-theta subscript t, 
Greek-phi subscript t) transmitted in a given direction
(Greek-theta subscript t, Greek-phi subscript t) to the
 differential luminous flux density
dE(subscript i)(Greek-theta subscript i, Greek-phi subscript i)
incident from a given direction of incidence (Greek-theta subscript i,
 Greek-phi subscript i) that produces it ...

   Notes: 
     (i) This distribution function is the basic parameter
for describing (geometrically) the transmitting properties
of a thin scattering film (with negligible internal scattering)
so that the transmitted radiation emerges from a point that
is not significant separated from the point of incidence of the
incident ray(s). The governing considerations are similar to those
for application of the bidirectional reflectance-distribution
function (BRDF), rather than the ... BSSRDF...
     (ii) It may have any positive value and will
approach infinity in the direction for regular transmission
(possibly by refraction without scattering).
     (iii) The spectral and polarization aspects must be 
defined for complete specification, since the BTDF as given
above only defines the geometric aspects.

7.5 Absorption. A general term for the process by which incident
flux is converted to another form of energy, usually and 
ultimately to heat.
    Note: All of the incident flux accounted for by the process
of reflection, transmission and absorption.

   7.5.1 Absorptance (Greek-small-alpha) =
(capital-Greek-phi) (subscript a)
/ (capital-Greek-phi) (subscript i). The ratio of the absorbed
flux to the incident flux.
    Note: The sum of the hemispherical reflectance, the
hemispherical transmittance, and the absorptance is one.

   7.5.2 Coefficient of attenuation (at a point in a given
direction), (Greek-mu). The decrement in flux per unit distance
in a given direction within a medium. It is defined by the
relation (capital-Greek-phi)(subscript x) = 
(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript o) e (raised to the minus Greek-mu*x
power), where (capital-Greek-phi)(subscript x) is the flux
at any distance x from a reference point having flux
(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript o). More generally,
(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript x) = 
(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript o) exp [- the integral
from o to x Greek-mu(x) dx] where the coefficient varies from
point to point; Greek-mu = Greek-mu(x) along the path.)

Since a number of people have asked me about it, here
is the info. on ordering NBS Monograph 160 ,
"Geometrical Considerations and Nomenclature for
Reflectance," by F.E. Nicodemus et al.

NBS 160 can be ordered from the National Technical Information

you will need an order number, which is this case is
PB273651. Orders should be sent to NTIS, Springfield,VA 22161.
NTIS will accept American Express, check, money order, 
VISA, or Mastercharge. For information call, (703) 487-4650,
orders can be placed at (800) 336-4700, and you can fax

Continuation of --
Summary of applicable definitions from
ANSI/IES RP-16-1986 "Nomenclature and
Definitions for Illuminating Engineering"

______________ my comments __________________________________

Section 8 deals with Testing Procedures, and has definitions
about devices to make physical measurements such as photometer,
reflectometer, and light meter. I don't think any of these
relate directly to image synthesis.

Section 9 deals with Lighting Calculations. It would be nice to
have some short, well defined terms to refer to calculation
methods to save the space listing all sorts of equations, references 
and/or pseudocode. It would seem that using illumination 
engineering terminology would help along these lines. Section
9 does have some useful terms, but a lot of it doesn't
apply to image synthesis. This is because the most common
methods used in illumination engineering are based on
calculating a single number for a simplified description of
an environment to use as a measure of the effectiveness of the
design. Besides not making calculations at the level of
spatial detail required in image synthesis, most of the methods
are geared to very minimal computing resource (e.g. like
a slide rule and a pencil). This is partly for historical
reasons, and partly because most people doing lighting design
have extremely small computing budgets. 

Anyway, in the standard there are definitions of a zonal factor
method and a zonal-cavity interreflectance method, in which the
 zones are solid conic angles from the light
source. These methods are different from the zonal method from
heat transfer for calculating transfer in  a participating
medium, and the zones are volumes of the medium. The zonal-cavity
method (illumination engr.) isn't applicable to image synthesis, 
but the zonal method (a.k.a. zone method, zoning method) is, so 
I would use the heat transfer interpretation of zone in this case. 

Also, what many of us would call radiosity methods are referred
to as flux transfer theory. I don't think switching to this
term would clarify anything. On the other hand, the standard
differentiates between a form factor (between two finite
surfaces) and a configuration factor (between a differential
and a finite surface). I think this terminology would be useful.

One other note -- another place to find NBS 160 is in the
"Radiometry" volume of the new three volume set "Physics-Based
Vision", by Wolff,Shafer & Healy (Jones & Bartlett pubs.) Check
if your library has or is getting this series.

------------------- begin summary --------------------------

9.1  Laws of illumination

   9.1.1 Inverse-square law. A law stating that the illuminance
E at a point on a surface varies directly with the intensity I
of a point source, and inversely as the square of the distance
d between the source and the point. If the surface at the point is
normal to the direction of the incident light, the law is
express (sic) by E = I/d**2.
   Note: For sources of finite size having uniform illuminance
this gives results that are accurate within one percent when d
is at least five times the maximum dimension of the source as 
viewed from the point on the surface. Even though practical
interior luminaires do not have uniform luminance, this
distance d is frequently used as the minimum for photometry
of such luminaires, when the magnitude of the measurement
error is not critical.

   9.1.1.1 Point source. A source of radiation whose dimensions
are sufficiently samll, compared with the distance between the
source and the irradiated surface, that these dimensions can
be neglected in calculations and measurements.

  9.1.2 Cosine law. A law stating that the illuminance on any
surface varies as the cosine of the angle of incidence. The
angle of incidence (Greek theta) is the angle between the normal
to the surface and the direction of the incident light. The 
inverse-square law and the cosine law can be combined as
E =(I cos(Greek theta))/d**2


....

9.5 Light distribution

9.5.1 Direct component. That portion of the light from a luminaire
that arrives at the work-plane without being reflected by
room surfaces.

....

9.5.4 Indirect component. That portion of the luminous flux from
a luminaire that arrives at the work-plane after being reflected
by room surfaces.

...

9.5.7 Interflection (Also called interreflection.) The multiple
reflection of light by the various room surfaces before it
reaches the work-plane or other specified surface of a room.

   9.5.7.1 Interflected component. (Also called interreflectance.)
That portion of the luminous flux from a luminaire that arrives
at the work-plane after being reflected one or more times from
room surfaces, as determined by the flux transfer theory
(Paragraph 9.5.7.2).
  
   9.5.7.2 Flux transfer theory. A method of calculating the 
illuminance in a room by taking into account the interreflection
of the light flux from the room surfaces based on the
average flux transfer between surfaces.

   9.5.7.3 Form factor, f(subscript 1-2). The ratio of the flux
directly received by surface 2 (and due to lambertian surface 1)
to the total flux emitted by surface1. It is used in flux
transfer theory.

f(subscript 1-2) = (capital-Greek-phi)(subscript 1->2)/
		   (capital-Greek-phi)(subscript 1)

Also the ratio of the average illuminace on surface 1 to the 
causative exitance of lambertian surface 2.

f(subscript 1-2) = E(subscript 1)/M(subscript 2)

Note: In the literature this term is also called angle factor,
configuration factor, geometrical factor, I-factor, illumination
factor and shape modulus.

   9.5.7.4 Configuration factor, c(subscript 1->2). The
ratio of illuminance on a surface at point 1 (due to the flux
directly received from lambertian surface 2) to the exitance
of surface 2. It is used in flux transfer theory.

    C(subscript 1-2) = E(subscript 1)/M(subscript 2)

Also the ratio of the differential flux directly received by
surface 2 (and due to element 1) to the total differential
flux emitted by differential lambertian surface element 1.

    C(subscript 1-2) = d(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript 1->2)/
			d(capital-Greek-phi)(subscript 1)

Note: In the literature this term is also called angle factor,
illumination factor, point configuration factor and sky factor.

   9.5.7.5 Wrong way "law". An informal recognition in the equations
E(subscript 2) = c(subscript 2-1) M(subscript 1) and
E(subscript 2) = f(subscript 2-1) M(subscript 1) that the 
configuration factor and form factor flux transfer is opposite to the
actual cause-effect flux transfer as indicate by the subscripts.

Conclusion of --
Summary of applicable definitions from
ANSI/IES RP-16-1986 "Nomenclature and
Definitions for Illuminating Engineering"

The remaining sections of RP-16-1986, 10. "Interior Lighting
Applications", 11. "Exterior Light Applications" and
12. "Nonlighting Applications" contain a lot of interesting
information, but, as I read it, no definitions that apply to 
image synthesis. Section 13 contains several useful tables ,
such as conversion factors and numerical values for the luminous
efficiency function. At the end of the document there is also a
list of useful references on vision and lighting.

I have put together a 3 page Latex document with the snappy title
"Suggested Units, Symbols, and Defining Equations for 
Computer Graphics Global Illumination Based on ANSI/IES
RP-16-1986." I can send the document, or the PostScript version
of it to anyone who would like to see the actual Greek 
characters. (I'm no expert with Latex, but the output
looks ok. Thanks to Filippo Tampieri for sending me a
template to get started).

Finally, I would like to emphasize that NONE of my mail
messages are in any way official, and only represent my
own personal opinions. Only the IES can issue official 
interpretations of RP-16-1986. My purpose in posting all of
this is to provide suggested notation and terminology to
improve communication in our area. I am NOT proposing that
when papers are reviewed that they should be judged by
conformance to this terminology -- any terminology that
is clearly defined and used consistently within a paper
is legitimate.

Status: R

I just wanted to add my 2 cents to the discussion of luminous efficacy.
(Sumant brought up the question of its relation to efficiency -- sorry to
backtrack like this.)

Luminous efficacy is defined in terms of lumens per watt.  Holly correctly
pointed out that this number includes losses due to inefficiencies in the
lamp or fixture or whatever, but there is something else that needs to be
pointed out.  Namely, the lumen is defined in terms of *human visual response*.

That is to say, the lumen is tied to physical units by the visual response
curve, V(lambda), and thus efficacy does not address so much the ability
of a lamp to turn electric energy into radiation, but its ability to turn
electric energy into VISIBLE light.  In fact, if we were to judge a lamp
solely on its ability to turn electricity into radiation, the incandescent
bulb would be considered one of the best, as it gives off most of its
energy in the near to far infrared band, and loses a relatively small amount
to convection and condunction.  Unfortunately, most of us don't see light
in the infrared, so it doesn't do us a whole lot of good (unless of course
our goal is to stay warm).

The maximum theoretically possible luminous efficacy for any source is
(by definition) 683 lumens/watt.  If a lamp were 100% efficient at
turning input power into light at the peak of the V(lambda) spectral
sensitivity curve (ie. 555 nanometers), then it would have this
efficacy.  Note, however, that the light coming off such a lamp would be
an eerie yellow-green color, which would not make for good dining ambiance.

This brings up another point, which is that efficacy is not the only goal
for a lamp manufacturer.  If the efficacy is achieved by putting too much
of the light energy into the middle of the visible spectrum at the expense
of taking too much away from the red and blue ends, the resulting illumination
will result in poor color rendering.  It won't be possible to tell one color
from another, simply because the light needed to show off the reds and blues
will be missing in the first place!  Low pressure sodium lamps and, to some
extent, high pressure sodium lamps (both popular in modern street lighting
applications) have this high efficacy, low color rendering characteristic.
(Perhaps our courts should employ such lighting...)

An ideal source that distributed its light evenly over the visible spectrum
and wasted nothing would have an efficacy of around 180 lumens/watt.  The
best commercial fluorescent lighting systems currently produce about 90
lumens/watt.  In some sense, this means we are at about 50% efficiency in
doing what we want to do.

It's interesting to note that the luminous efficacy of solar radiation is
also about 90 lumens/watt.  In this case, the power in the denominator is not
input power but energy content.  That is to say, we could allow 90 lumens
of sunlight into our space and we would have an associated solar heat gain
of 1 watt.  If we were running an air conditioner in our building, this watt
would have to be removed by our HVAC system at some cost.  This cost would
be comparable to the cost of removing the heat from a high-efficiency
fluorescent system, but at least we didn't have to pay for the watt to
produce the 90 lumens in the first place.

The luminous efficacy of skylight radiation is better still at about 120
lumens/watt, and if the infrared component of sunlight is filtered out using
selective glazing, the efficacy of sunlight can also be improved to around
130 lumens/watt.  This helps make the case for using daylight instead of
electric light in interior spaces dominated by cooling (like LA!).

Well, I think I've used up more than 2 cents of your time, so I'm off.

Thanks, Holly, I got a copy of ANSI/IES RP-16-1986.

I applaud your effort in advancing standards in global illumination.

As you might remember from previous e-mails back in June, I have been trying to
develop an object oriented representation of light sources and optical
properties of materials that can be used in both traditional and global
illumination rendering. Hall's book presents physically-based reflection models
that can be used to generate parameters familiar to those used in traditional
rendering.

The more difficult task is to provide instance variables and virtual functions
that make sense for all subclasses of a Light base class.

Soon, I hope to throw out some ideas about generalized lights.

Keep me (get me) on the distribution list,

Hi Globillumers--

Besides terminology, another subject we have discussed here is
the possibility of establishing some reference solutions for
use in testing etc. Since it will be a while before we can
agree on the "ultimate" method for calculating an image, I thought
perhaps we could try the consensus route to establishing
reference solutions. The idea is we could develop a suite
of test images by taking turns specifying the input and format
of the image.

Below I have written out a simple, first test case. It is basically
the empty,diffuse,gray test case that Greg posted radiosity
values for on hobbes.lbl.gov. I have tried to structure the
description so that the only variable is how you choose
to calculate the radiance at each pixel. 

Here is what I propose:

1. Using this description, generate an image. Submit it
by Dec. 1, 1992 by placing it by anonymous ftp on
tiber.nist.gov (129.6.2.23) into the directory pub/holly.
Be sure that the permissions on the file are set so that
it is universally readable. Also, send me email that you have
placed an image there so I will be sure to pick it up.

2. I will collect the results and compute an average image,
and a standard deviation image (i.e. for each pixel I will
compute the average value from all respondents, and the
sample standard deviation in values from all respondents).
I will also compute other statistics that the group feels
would be relevant.

3. The combined results will be made available to everyone
via anonymous ftp.

4. Someone else defines another (probably more challenging)
test case and collects the results.


I am putting this message, along with a sample image I computed 
in pub/holly. The sample image is in the simple format describe below,
as well as a few other popular formats.



==============================================================
=============== Begin Test Case Description ==================
==============================================================
Geometry and Properties
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The geometry is an empty rectangular room extending
from (0,0,0) to (10,3,6). The sole light source
is in the center of the ceiling, at y = 3.0. The light source
is square and 0.5 units per side. All surfaces are Lambertian.

Here is an off-style file definition of the geometry.
There are 12 points and 7 polygons. The x,y,z values of
each of the points are listed first. Each polygon is 
defined by number of vertices (4 in this case for all polygons)
and the indices of those vertices. That is, the first
polygon is defined by the points (0,3,0),(10,3,0),(10,0,0)
and (0,0,0). I have defined the light source slightly below
the ceiling -- if you can, the ceiling should have a hole in
it so the light source can be perfectly flush at y = 3.0.
The first four polygons are the walls,
and they are 50 % reflective. The fifth polygon is the ceiling, which
is 70 % reflective. The sixth is the floor which is 30 %
reflective.  The seventh is the light source, for which
the emitted radiance is 10 w/m^2-steradian, and which is 0%
reflective.

Generating an Image
+++++++++++++++++++

View from: (9., 1.75, 1.)
View to: (1., 1.75, 6.) i.e.unnormalized vector indicating
          view direction is (-8, 0,5)
"Up" direction: (0,1,0)
Field of view: 45 degrees
Image resolution: 50 x 50 pixels.

Sample the center of the pixel only (i.e. no sampling
at various locations in the pixel and filtering for
antialiasing).

Scaling of radiances: Use simple linear scaling of radiances
to the range 0-255 by multiplying by 8000  and clipping values above
255. The value 8000 assumes you use 10 for the light source radiance, and
was chosen to have the approximate average radiance value map to 128. 
(i.e., if you for some reason always set your light source value to 1,
you would multiply all of the values by 80000, etc.)
Do not include any gamma correction in the mapping to 0-255.

Output format: binary file, one byte/pixel for a total of
50x50 bytes. Start with lower left hand corner, write results row
by row, with the last value being the upper right hand corner.If
writing things out in this format seriously holds up your entry,
please send in what you can, and give me a description of the 
format.


NOTE:
If you compare radiance values you compute to the data in the
directory on hobbes.lbl.gov remember that file has results
for radiosities which are PI times the radiance for a Lambertian
surface.

Hi --

Just a few notes to encourage you all to submit your version of 
the test image:

-- If you are concerned about getting credit for submitting an
image, I will include you on a list of contributors that
accompanies the results.

-- If on the other hand you are concerned about anonymity, I will
keep your name off of any publicly accessible files.

-- The original "samp" files I posted were somewhat noisy. I
computed a higher quality solution that is now available
as pub/holly/hollysentry.simple_format.

-- There is one other entry besides mine, and they aren't
exactly the same, so we definitely need more entries.

-- Timing is not an issue -- both of the entries so far
took cpu days to compute. 

-- If you can compute an image, but aren't confident in the results,
send it in anyway.  I will put it in a separate category to be
used to get an idea of the range of values computed by different
methods.


If there is some aspect of the scene/image description that
is making it difficult for you to generate an image, please
let me know. 

Also, assuming there are more entries, what sort of statistics
would people be interested in to summarize the results?

-- Holly

full reference and any relevant keywords.  I have all this year's SIGGRAPH,
Eurographics rendering workshop, Graphics Interface and CGI papers, and will
be getting the Eurographics proceedings papers soon.  If there are other
conference papers worth including, please let me know - I don't track the
engineering or computational geometry oriented conferences so am undoubtedly
missing a few references at this point.  I can send you the latest bibs if you
need them right now; otherwise wait a few weeks until the new ones are out.


Incidentally, if you've ever wanted to do radiosity studies on cows (after
all, there's a form factor equation for a cow), you may wish to FTP to:

	avalon.chinalake.navy.mil [129.131.31.11]

There are some high-quality models in /pub/objects/obj/Viewpoint in Wavefront

Globillumers,

I am giving a talk on global illumination algorithms to my
department on Tuesday, and one question comes to mind that I am
not sure I could answer adequately if asked.

The question is this:  Suppose we could completely solve the
global illumination problem; that is, suppose we had an
algorithm that gave perfectly accurate solutions with tight
error bounds, did perfect discontinuity meshing and
reconstruction, handled arbitrary BRDFs, and was really, really
fast.  What good would it be?  Who would really use it?

Certainly, lighting designers and architects could use such a
thing, but could anyone else benefit?  How "important" a problem
is global illumination, anyway?  Other than intellectual
curiosity, are there any really good reasons for studying it?

Thanks, I look forward to getting your input...

If you are interested in the "seamless" merging of real images and
computer-generated images (which I call CAR for computer augmented
reality), then an accurate solution for global illumination is essential.
Of course that only begs the next question: what is CAR for?
I'll let you answer this one...

Re: Who would really use an accurate global illumination 
solution?

Well, here's my two cents:

-- People that need to take visibility into account for
safety reasons -- e.g. determining the visibility of exit
signs through smoke, visibility of road signs in rain and
fog, visibility of radio towers through smog, visibility
of buoys in the water (a great Pacific NW application. Some 
people here at NIST did a study on this one and wanted to
use simulations, but in the absence of any good software
tools had to limit themselves with what
they could do with photography and rowing around a lake). The
physical experiments for these applications are tough, because
you need a range of subjects with various types of vision, and
then you have to wait around for the full range of extreme
weather conditions you are interested in.

-- Designer's for whom appearance under many lighting conditions
is important, e.g. the Siggraph paper from the people at
Toyota about predicting the appearance of cars under different
weather conditions.

I think the most important applications for precise radiative
transfer solutions involve non-human sensors, i.e. the
interpretation of satellite images, the design of machine
vision systems, and design of various weapons systems. 
Chris Borel (LANL) and N. Goel (SUNY Bing.) are both on this 
list, and both have done work simulating what plants will
look like under various lighting conditions from satellites.
Steve Shafer at CMU has been working for quite awhile in
the area of using at least some aspects of global illumination
solutions for machine vision. At Georgia Tech we have been working
on getting simulations that are good enough that they could
be incorporating in a CAD system, so that you could test how
difficult it would be to assemble a group of parts while they
were still in the design phase. And, of course people have
been doing radiosity type solutions for a long time to test
models of missile sensors. (I'm sure Boeing does some of this.)
In all of these applications you can get some data from physical
experiments. But, the experiments can be expensive and difficult
to control. Accurate simulations let you examine a much wider range
of conditions. Furthermore, images that just "look good" are
worthless for non-human sensors, since they just operate on the
incident electromagnetic radiation, and don't do the sophisticated
processing that the human visual system does.

Then there are applications that are more speculative or open
to question. If we are going to use "virtual reality" systems
to train people by putting them into the actual environment they
are going to be working in, how accurate does the rendering system
have to be? It would seem like some applications -- like 
training to perform operations in outer space -- would require
very accurate illumination.

Recall that global illumination is a special case of radiative heat transfer.
An efficient, accurate solution to the first would undoubtedly have

calculations for cancer treatment.  There are of course many others.

Hi Globillumers --

Well, here are the results for the reference image experiment.
The bad news is that there were not a large number of
participants. The good news is that we got remarkable agreement
on the resulting image using four distinctively different
approaches. 

The four entries were from --

    Raphael Compagnon (COMPAGNON@eldp.epfl.ch)
     using SUPERLITE to calculate radiances, and "Radiance"
     to find the visible surface at each pixel

    Chris Christou (cgc@physiology.oxford.ac.uk)
      using a radiosity solution to get a radiosity
      for each surface, ray-tracing to find surface visible
      through each pixel and then gathering the radiosity
      result to calculate the pixel value

    me
      using my own Monte Carlo path tracing program

    Greg Ward (greg@hobbes.lbl.gov)
      using "Radiance"


Let R = (max value - min value) reported for each pixel,

R = 0 for  607 pixels
  = 1 for 1425 pixels
  = 2 for  341 pixels
  = 3 for   79 pixels
  = 4 for   20 pixels
  = 5 for    8 pixels
  = 6 for    4 pixels
  = 7 for    4 pixels
  = 8 for    7 pixels
  = 9 for    2 pixels
  = 12 for   2 pixels
  = 14 for   1 pixel

Under pub/holly on tiber.nist.gov, I have posted an image
fin_res  in a number of different formats. The red channel
in fin_res is the minimum value reported at each pixel, 
the green is the average value, ane the blue is the maximum
value. 

Since tiber isn't meant to be an archive -- it's supposed to
be used for transferring data via anonymous ftp to people
outside of NIST -- I can only plan on leaving the results
there for about a month.

	in this field for that last 4 years. Accurate simulations of
	irradiance conditions are vital to simulating canopy-scale

Hi --
I am putting together a course called "Making Radiosity

to pack in as much practical information as possible.
In particular, I am looking for information that
might not be available in technical papers. There
will be the usual formal sections in the notes, but I
would also like to include a section of short impressions,
tips and anecdotes on using radiosity. I know a lot of
you have implemented radiosity algorithms. It would
be helpful if you sent  your brief tips or
stories that would be helpful to someone new in the
area. This could range from the more serious 
(like saving additions by storing cumulative 
delta form factors in the hemi-cube) to the
more frivolous (adaptive meshing via
strategically located one-sided area rugs). 
You will be credited for your contribution in
the notes (or in the case of more
embarrassing anecdotes or sleazy tricks I am
willing to protect your anonymity). 
You can either email your response direct to

Hi, again, globillumers,

As you may recall, when I posted the reference image problem
last fall, I suggested that after we got results that
someone else propose another test problem. Attached is
a new test problem from Nick Holliman. It is more challenging
since it is now a non-empty room, and all the surfaces in
the image are illuminated indirectly.

Since Nick doesn't have ftp access, I am posting this and
collecting entries. (My entry is currently churning away on my
machine). Since I wasn't inundated with  files last time,
this time you should submit the result in any image format
that is convenient for you, just let me know what it is.
You can put them on tiber.nist.gov using anonymous ftp, 
under pub/holly/CASE2. In the same directory you will find
Nick's results in sgi .rgb format and in ppm format (ppm is
ascii and I also put the man page for the ppm format in CASE2).

If you are interested in participating, please try to 
send your entry by June 1, 1993.

I haven't had any complaints from the system people here, so
I have left the results from the first test image under
pub/holly/CASE1.

the dark region of the room, where the surfaces receive indirect light only.
I kept to the same assumptions you suggested for the original model.

I am not too famliar with the off format but I guess it uses a right hand
co-ord system and orders polygon vertices clockwise. I translated to this 
from a file with counter clockwise vertices so I hope it works ok.

I will mail you my converged solution in a btoa conversion of a rgb file
later today.

May I join the globillum list? 
Moreover, does anyone know the form of the integration function 
that characterizes the sensor response of a consumer 
videocamera (like Grundig VS-C55 VHS color PAL, or similar 
devices)" I am interested in the function which relates the 
light signal input to the PAL composite output (possibly 
including pickup parameters gamma or antigamma correction, no. 
of linearities, white balance, RGB filtering, etc. , the 
typicla parameters of a CCD device). 
Thanks in advance for your help.

Hi --

I have a few things I wanted to mention:

-- I am still hoping for more solutions to the second
test image that Nick Holliman proposed (you can get the
problem definition from tiber.nist.gov under pub/holly/CASE2).
There is a fair amount of diversity in the current soluions,
so it would be helpful to have more entries.

-- Did anyone ever respond to Elena Rodriguez's question
about video cameras? I don't know anything about PAL or
Grundig recorders, but I doubt that there is published quantitative
information about the relationship between light source input
and pixel values that result after you convert from video to
RGB. We have a Sony Super Pro 2000 here, and there is essentially
no quantitative data with it. I suppose you could set up your
own calibration tests -- has anybody done this with a
consumer video camera?

-- There were a couple of interesting papers in the most
recent issue of the IES journal (Winter 1993):

"A New Method of Generating Accurate Color Renderings of 
Architectural Spaces" by M. Smith, which describes a simple
method of converting illumination simulation results to RGB
values based on some tests done comparing images and scale
models.

"Near-Field Photometry: A New Approach" by I. Ashdown, which
describes a new device for measuring light source 
distributions.

Status: R

Our group has been working a few years now on a "luminance mapper", ie. a
video camera connected to a digitizer board for the purpose of obtaining
an image of absolute luminance measurements.

Robert Clear is in charge of the project (bobc@hobbes.lbl.gov) and
Vincent Berrutto is the research associate who has done much of the work
(vincent@hobbes.lbl.gov).

We have been working with a black and white Hitachi KP-140 security camera
connected to a TARGA M8 digitizer board.  The spectral response of the camera
has been corrected to the photopic curve with a pair of color filters.
Readings are within 10% of those of a good photometer, and usually within 5%.

The main thing we learned in this project is that video cameras and
equipment often "play around" with the gain and gamma response in
unpredictable ways.  The reason we ended up with the KP-140 camera is
that it has internal switches for disabling Automatic Gain Control
(AGC) and gamma correction.  Using this camera, we were able to get a
linear response from the camera over its useful dynamic range.
Similarly, many modern digitizer cards "enhance" the video signal in
various ways before capturing an image.  It is impossible in most cases
to figure out what the captured values correspond to in terms of real
luminance afterwards.  The image may look nice, but it's useless as
data.  The TARGA M8 card for the PC (if it's still available) has proven
reasonably reliable in producing repeatable data points.

We have not looked at color cameras yet or even examined the video signal
too closely.  We only looked at the combined system and performed overall
calibrations.  We would be happy to supply you with the results if you
wish to use the same system in your own work.

Hi  --

Once again, I have a few different things to mention --

A question:
Whenever people here look at my Monte Carlo images with noise
in them, they immediately tell me that it should be easy
to get rid of that noise in post-processing with the right
filter. I have never found a filtering process that reduces
the noise without adding some new objectionable artifact. Has
anyone had success reducing noise in MC solutions with a
post-process?

A request:
In the next few months there are a lot of conferences going on
with a lot of Globillum papers. I don't think anyone has
the resources to get to all of these events. It would
be great if people would post information about papers
they heard and/or presented. Last month I attended Graphics
Interface 93, and there were at least 5 Globillum related papers:

1. "An Adaptive Discretization Method for Progressive
Radiosity" Lalonde (lalonde@cs.ubc.ca)

2. "Geometric Simplification for Indirect Illumination
Calculations"  Rushmeier,Patterson & Veerasamy
 (holly@cam.nist.gov)

3. "Computing Illumination from Area Light Sources by
Approximate Contour Integration'  Vedel (vedel@dmi.ens.fr)

4."Spatially Nonuniform Scaling Functions for High
Contrast Images" Chiu, Herf, Shirley,Swamy,Wang & 
Zimmerman (shirley@cs.indiana.edu)

5. "Common Illumination between Real and Computer Generated
Scenes" Fournier, Gunawan, Romanzin (fournier@cs.ubc.ca)

I put the abstracts for these papers under pub/holly/GI93abstracts
on tiber.nist.gov if you want to get more info about them
via anonymous ftp.


Finally, an update:
I am waiting on some information on one of the test case 2
entries, and then I will post the results. So, there is
still time to enter. A volunteer has already come forward
for test case 3.

Finally here are the results for the second test case.
The results showed excellent agreement, despite the
difficulty of computing an image in which all of the
illumination was indirect. There are two images summarizing
the results on tiber.nist.gov under pub/holly/CASE2
Case2a.ppm which has results for the original scaling factor
of 500,000; and Case2b.ppm which has results for a scaling

Subject: radiosity method definition
Status: R

Over time I have heard the term "radiosity method" applied
to a lot of different rendering procedures. Some times it 
is used for anything that can be used for a "walk through", some
times for any method that can simulate "color bleeding". 
Generally, I don't see much point over arguing over what
is a radiosity method and what isn't (i.e. is Radiance a 
radiosity method, or radiosity-like method?)

However, for the purpose of standing up in front of a lot
of people to talk about radiosity methods, I would like
to come up with a reasonably short but informative
definition of radiosity methods. Here is what I have --
please take your best shot at correcting/improving it:


What is radiosity?

Radiosity is the radiant energy/(time-area) leaving
a surface.

What is the radiosity method?

There is no single radiosity method. Radiosity methods are
a class of methods for solving the global illumination
problem for image synthesis. Radiosity methods are distinguished
by the following features:

 -- objects in the environment are discretized
 -- a solution is obtained by  solving simultaneous
    equations 
 -- the quantities of light are computed in object space,
     rather than screen space

The "classic" radiosity method assumes environments composed
only of Lambertian, opaque surfaces with the radiosity of
each surface being uniform. In the "classic method" a full
set of simultaneous equations is solved for radiosities
of all of the surfaces in the environment.

sounds good to me.

I was going to say "the radiosity method simulates global
illumination by solving a system of equations whose unknowns are
the light at various parts of the scene.  The scene can be
discretized and the system can be solved in a variety of ways."

The global-illumination problem is to compute a solution to the
rendering equation, an integral equation.  I think that means you
either use finite element methods (FEM), which is what I think of as
"radiosity methods" or you use Monte Carlo methods (MC) which end up
being advanced types of "ray-tracing methods".

FEM and MC approaches to radiation transfer go way back, nuclear
engineering, thermal engineering, and illumination engineering.  I
think graphics had done a lot that is new and unique, and it would be
interesting to discuss that and distinguish our results from earlier
engineering work.

The "classical" radiosity equation can be obtained from the general 
rendering equation by using two major assumptions:

1: the scene is discretized into patches with constant radiosity
2: the radiosity of each patch is direction independent (diffuse)

It turned out that the second assumption is not necessary, since extended 
versions of the radiosity algorithm are able to simulate directional 
diffuse and specular transfers.

Galerkin methods are based on a modified version of assumption 1: the 
radiosity of a patch is not constant, but approximated by a set of basis 
functions.

In my opinion, radiosity methods are characterized by a discretized scene 
and a piecewise approximation of the radiosity function. This piecewise 
approximation of the radiosity function has to be computed by solving
a set of modified radiosity equations.

The view-independence is simply a result of this definition. Radiance is no 
radiosity method, because no radiosity equation is solved.

Note that Monte Carlo methods can be used for form factor approximation. 
Therefore it is not correct to say MC methods are generally no radiosity 
methods!

Subject: Nicodemus Eq. C10
Date: 	Tue, 17 Aug 1993 23:17:39 PDT
Status: RO


In the famous monograph by Nicodemus et. al., Appendix C contains
a very clear discussion of diffuse and specular reflection in terms
of BRDF's and reflectances.  But I don't understand one of the terms
in Equation C.10 (pg. 44)- specifically, why he takes the delta function 
of (sin^2(theta_r)-sin^2(theta_i)) rather than simlpy (theta_r - theta_i).
To make matters move confusing, when Pat Hanrahan mentions this 
forumulation in the Cohen/Wallace radiosity book (it's out now, and
every serious rendering person should have a copy) he uses a difference
of cosines and includes an additional cosine corection term!

If you don't have the monograph nearby, the point is to find a BRDF
that satisfies perfect specular reflection.  You have a hemisphere
centered around a point P, where the XY plane is the tangent plane to
the surface, and the Z axis is the normal.  The polar coordinate system
associated with this puts theta as the angle between a vector and the
Z axis, and psi is the angle between the projection onto the base plane
and the X axis.  That is, for a unit vector V, cos theta = (V . Z),
and cos psi = ((V - (V . Z)Z) . X).  If your outgoing direction is
(theta_r, psi_r), then you know your specular input is coming from 
(theta_r, psi_r + pi) or (theta_r, psi_r - pi).  You want to pick out
this direction as you sweep (theta_i, psi_i), so I'd form three delta 
functions (pretend & is a Greek lower-case delta):
  d-theta = &(theta_r - theta_i)
  d-psi-1 = &(psi_r - psi_i - pi)
  d-psi-2 = &(psi_r - psi_i + pi)
So that when you form d-theta * (d-psi-1 + d-psi-2) you only get
a non-zero result when you're sitting on the incident direction.
We all agree on d-psi-1 and -2, but d-theta varies:
  Nicodemus: d-theta = 2 &(sin^2(theta_r) - sin^2(theta_i))
       (note the extra 2)
  Hanrahan:  d-theta = &(cos(theta_r) - cos(theta_i))/cos(theta_i)
       (note the extra 1/cos(theta_i))

Can anyone suggest a consistent interpretation?

In response to Andrews's point about the delta functions 
for specular reflection:

You want to define the delta function for the thetas
so that when you integrate over the incident hemisphere you
only get a non-zero value at theta_r = theta_1. Since
you are integrating over cos(theta_i)sin(theta_i) d theta_i,
and this is equal to (1/2)d (theta_i)**2, you end up
with the extra factor of 2 and the theta**2 in the delta
function. In the new radiosity book, I think there is
a sin(theta_i) missing in the integration over the
hemisphere in equation (2.30) on page 31.

After I wrote my first response I started wondering
why this hadn't been noticed in the Siggraph radiosity 
course notes.  The reason is that in the notes the version
of (2.30) is correct, in that it uses
  sin(theta_i) d theta_i = - d(cos(theta_i))

In other words, the expression for the specular reflectance
is correct, but the d theta_i in (2.30) should be
d(cos(theta_i)).

Overall, my personal preference is to treat specular reflectance
as a special case, and not to bother squeezing it into
the BRDF form. The pure specular case illustrates that BRDF
is not bounded (i.e. it isn't a per cent reflectance). Otherwise
I can't see the advantange of this formulation.

I agree that having delta functions in the BRDF has dubious
practical value.  But as an example it demonstrates why the 
"D" is in there in the name, and is a good motivational step
for getting to the reflectance and reflectance factor.

Thanks for the perfect answer, Holly!

Andrew,

Both formulations (Nicodemus' and Hanrahan's) are correct !

It's all a question of normalization : as you note in your message, the Dirac 
delta distribution is zero everywhere but at the origin. At that point it does 
not have a value in the usual sense, and is sometimes considered to take an 
"infinite" value. In fact the Dirac distribution is really uniquely determined 
by its normalization condition, that the integral of the distribution equal 
one. Note this is a one-dimensional integral over the entire domain of real 
numbers.

In the case of the  reflectance, the reason why a Dirac distribution is used is 
to limit the ideal specular reflection to the exact mirror direction. But the 
normalization needed is different: what must be physically ensured is that 
the total energy flux reflected according to the specified reflectance be equal 
to the incident energy flux (ignoring the scalar "specular reflectance" 
thrown in front of the delta functions).

This reflected energy flux is equal to the integral over the reflected 
hemisphere of the reflected radiance, times cos (theta_r), times the 
differential solid angle d_omega.

Therefore the ratio of the reflected energy flux to the incident flux is

integral (over hemisphere) rho(theta_r, phi_r) cos( theta_r) d_omega

and the exact form of rho(theta_r, phi_r) must ensure that this integral 
equals one.


if you spell out d_omega = sin(theta_r) d theta_r d phi_r, you see that the 
integration over phi_r is trivial, and a factor of &(phi_r - phi_i - pi) in rho 
works just fine. But as for theta_r, the integral is that of

	rho * cos(theta_r) * sin(theta_r) d theta_r

it's easy to see that 

	cos(theta_r) sin(theta_r) d theta_r =  ( d sin^2(theta_r) ) / 2

Thus the expression in Nicodemus' paper, where a change of variable in the 
integral brings us back to the usual Dirac integral.

As for Hanrahan's expression, consider the change of variable u=cos(theta): 
since
	d cos(theta_r) = - sin(theta_r) d theta_r,

you see that using &( cos(theta_r) - cos(  theta_i) ) there is only a cosine term 
left under the integral that makes it different from the Dirac integral. This is 
precisely why Hanrahan divides his reflectance by cos( theta_i) (remember, 
at the point of interest, cos(theta_i) = cos( theta_r) !

Well, I hope this lengthy explanation helped you at least a bit. Take care !

Hi --

I have placed the description file format that Greg Ward
developed (and that I mentioned at the globillum meeting
at SIGGRAPH) on tiber.nist.gov as a shar file called 
Description.File.Format.shar. I can email a copy to anyone who
doesn't have ftp.

This file format is part of a project to develop guidelines
for manufacturers of products like furniture and lighting
fixtures to provide the data that is needed for lighting
simulation and rendering. It is important for the format
to be complete, and for it to be independent of the
rendering technique to be used. Please check through it
and see if the current description meets these criteria.

Manufacturers are only going to be interested in providing
this data if they can see that it is going to promote the
exposure of their products. If as a community we can
settle on a format and use it in many different 
freely available and commercial rendering packages,
we can make it worthwhile to companies to provide the data.

Sorry for not replying sooner and clearing this up.

Francois and Holly are obviously both right. The two
formulations are equivalent. Actually Don Mitchell
suggested the formulation I used; we both thought it
was more "obvious" that way than the way that 

Nicodemus wrote it.

(There is a classic story
about von Neumann. He's teaching a class on advanced
math for quantum mechanics and is working through a proof
on the board. Halfway through he skips a couple steps
and says the derivation is obvious. Somebody raises their
hand and says it's not obvious to him. At which point,
von Neumann pauses, thinks for a few minutes, walks out
of the room and paces the halls for five minutes. He
comes back and declares, "yes, it is obvious" and then 

proceeds with the lecture.)

I can't figure how I introduced in the rewrite of the notes.

By the way, I am producing a much longer, expanded version of  
those notes. I'd be interested in peoples comments on what
I wrote.

Yours,
Pat

About the von Neumann story......

I first heard this basic story in 1968 told by an SMU math prof, about
one of his profs.  I pretty sure the subject was NOT von Neumann.
I've always regarded the story as a generic campus myth (as in urban
myths).

Does anyone have (1) more evidence for von Neumann or (2) heard the same
story about someone else?

So far objections to the group seem to be placement --
sci.engr.lighting and misc.consumers.house.lighting have

it would be misread as sci.lightning).

Does anybody subscribe to the mailing list mentioned

REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION
(respond to news.groups)

Proposed name:  sci.lighting
Status:  unmoderated

This is the official request for discussion on creation of a new newsgroup,
the desirability of which has already been discussed at some length in a
mailing list called "lighting", maintained by Jonathan Hardis at NIST
(lighting@garnet.nist.gov).  The consensus of that group (which has about
150 subscribers) is that a newsgroup is desirable, because each user has
more control over how and when to read the postings to a newsgroup than
to a distribution mailing list.  It is felt that the current traffic on the
mailing list would substantially shift to the newsgroup, where the
discussions would benefit from the input from a wider audience.

The object of sci.lighting is to provide a forum for the discussion of all
aspects of the science and art involved in the creation of lighting methods
and solutions for safe, productive, and enjoyable use of  the built
environment, and in theater and film and related fields.  The term "built
environment" includes not only architecture, but also transportation media
such as roadways and aviation-related construction.  This statement is
intended to be as broad as possible in its inclusion of all topics related to
natural and manufactured light.  A representative list of some of the broad
categories of topics which would be appropriate for discussion in
sci.lighting follows.  The fact that a topic does not appear on the list does
not indicate that that topic could not be discussed.

Eye, vision and visibility

Manufactured light sources
Daylight availability/application
Psychological and nonvisual concerns

Subject: ANALYTICAL ILLUMINATION, new approach
Organization: University of Rostock, CS Dept. (Germany)
Date: Mon, 13 Sep 1993 12:28:33 GMT

Hi,
researchers in computer graphics.

I  post  here  to  guide  your  attention  to  an  article  about
analytical  illumination techniques, commonly known as radiosity.
As  u know radiosity was developed from thermal engineering under
some  sharp  constraints.  Hence  this  technique  is  limited to
planar,  opaque  and  ideal diffuse surfaces in origin. After the
last  few  years  a  number of investigations were made to extend
radiosity in some directions.

All  these  improvements base on the original formula designed by
Cohen and Greenberg. Hence the philosophy off all improvements is
to add special parts to the basic double-area-integral formula to
involve special effects.
That  means  that  all  extensions of basic radiosity theory stay
particular solutions. What IMHO is needed is an analytical theory
of  global  illumination  without  all  the  restrictions. Such a
theory  should  work  in  general. Having this theory we can make
certain   assumptions  to  fit  it  into  our  needs,  i.e.  make
assumptions  for  special  geometrical  surfaces  or  for certain
optical properties.

This theory  is  described  and explained in an article availbale
via anonymous ftp from

                  ftp.informatik.uni-rostock.de
                 in pub/graphics named illu.tar.Z and illu.ps.Z

It  is obvious that a general theory is very formal and therefore
unsuitable   to   practice.  However  all  applications  to  real
environments may be derived out of this theory. Some examples are
given in the above article.

In  addition  to  that  analytical  illumination  must pay strong
attention  to  physics.  Though  if u hate physics, do *not* read
this.  For  all  who are interested in understanding, I'll try to
explain  everything  best  I can. Please send me your comments on
what  is  hard  to  understand or to follow. I need your comments
and/or  questions  to  find  out  which  parts  of theory must be
explained  more  detailed,  which  figures  are misleading, which
mathematical  approaches  are  to  complicated,  ....  (I sent an
extended  abtract of this theory to 4th EG workshop on rendering.
The  referees  did  not  understand all things correctly, because
they  were  poorly explained. Unfortunately  they  did not  wrote
what was misunderstood.)

OK,  that's  it.  I'll  be  appreciated  about  any  comment, but
remember:  *Some*  physics is necessary and some mathematics too.
AND be always aware of the following fact: The aim of this theory
is  *not*  to  create  nice looking pictures. I'm sure u all know
nice   looking   pics  out  of  former  particular  solutions  of
analytical  illumination. 

Please email comments and critical hints directly to

              nic@informatik.uni-rostock.de


Best regards
Nico

ps.  The  article  is  written  in  LATEX. If someone can not use
LATEX, and can't print postscript, she/he can email me and I'll send a
printout via air mail.  pps. Sorry to all EG93 visitors who were

Once a again a few different things:

1. I am writing a short survey paper on computer graphics
techniques for computing radiative transfer in
participating media for a heat transfer workshop I am going to.
Its clear that the hierarchical approach would be really
useful in a zonal (i.e. radiosity for volumes) method, and
I have heard people say that they have implemented such 
an approach. Does anybody have any references for results?
If you haven't written anything formal, could you send
me email about what you did which I can list as a 
"Personal Communication." 
(I would try to implement something myself but I need to
get this paper done in the next two weeks. As it is I have
been busy rewriting Monte Carlo ray tracing stuff for some 
combustion problems. Say what you will about radiosity vs.
Monte Carlo, if you need to modify your code in a hurry
for a new application Monte Carlo is definitely the way to go.)

2. In the discussion of the proposed "sci.lighting" 
newsgroup the main objection has been that it is too high up
in the news group hierarchy. People who are concerned
about Usenet but have nothing to do with lighting at
all have proposed  "sci.tech.lighting" or "sci.applied.lighting".
People involved in lighting feel this would discourage
some posters who might want to discuss the aesthetic
aspects of lighting. If you have an opinion one way or another 
please post to "news.groups".

3. Just a reminder that on tiber.nist.gov under pub/holly
you can pick up "Description.File.Format.shar". Please
send comments on the format to Greg Ward or myself.
Also, under pub/holly/CASE3 you can find the third
proposed test scene (the one with a sphere). If you have
trouble seeing stuff listed on tiber, try "ls -l", and if
still nothing shows up please let me know.

A few things --

1. If you are interested in submitting an image
for "case 3" the deadline is November 24.

2. I have noticed that a number of people have picked up the
proposed description file format, but I haven't heard any
comments about it. Apparently the Inventor format is becoming
popular. As I read it though, it isn't designed for BRDF data
or photometric descriptions of light sources, so it isn't
really useful accurate illumination simulations.

3. The news group sci.engr.lighting passed, so it should
be showing up on your news reader soon.

4. In response to my inquiry about hierarchical methods for
participating media, there is a paper on this topic:

to Participating Media", Proceedings of the First Bilkent
Computer Graphics Conference on Advanced Techniques in 
Animation, Rendering and Visualization, July 12-14, 1993
Ankara, Turkey, pp. 43-53. 

The paper discusses specific issues related to applying
the hierarchical method to participating media ,and gives
timing results for an implemention.

5. If you are a US citizen finishing up a Ph.D., please
consider applying to the NRC/NIST post-doc program. The
application requires writing a proposal which will be
reviewed by an NRC panel. Applications are due January 15.
The post-doc would start in Fall of 1994. Base salary

Title: 
Structured Sampling and Reconstruction of Illumination for Image Synthesis

Degree:  Ph.D., University of Toronto, Department of Computer Science

Author:  George Drettakis

Abstract:

An important goal of image synthesis is to achieve accurate, efficient
and consistent sampling and reconstruction of illumination varying over
surfaces in an environment. A new approach is introduced for the
treatment of diffuse polyhedral environments lit by area light sources,
based on the identification of important properties of illumination
structure. The properties of unimodality and curvature of illumination
in unoccluded environments are used to develop a high quality sampling
algorithm which includes error bounds. An efficient algorithm is
presented to partition the scene polygons into a mesh of cells, in
which the visible part of the source has the same topology.  A fast
incremental algorithm is presented to calculate the backprojection,
which is an abstract representation of this topology.  The behaviour of
illumination in the penumbral regions is carefully studied, and is
shown to be monotonic and well behaved within most of the mesh cells.
An algorithm to reduce the mesh size, and an algorithm which selects
between linear and quadratic interpolants are presented.  The results
show that the mesh size and the degrees of the interpolants can be
reduced without significant degradation of image quality. The preceding
algorithms are combined into a complete structured sampling approach
that allows accurate and efficient representation of illumination using
interpolating polynomials for scenes with occlusion.  Images with
accurate shadows can be produced from the structured representation
using either ray-casting or polygon rendering hardware. Finally, it is
shown that our methodology generalises easily to the global
illumination problem. An iterative solution to a Galerkin finite
element approach is proposed, and it is shown how the structured
algorithms provide a good initial approximation for the iteration,
enhance efficiency for numerical integration and allow adaptive mesh
modification. The structure-driven global illumination algorithm thus
promises significant improvement over previous higher-order finite
element solutions.

Also, in case you've given up reading comp.graphics and related newsgroups,
there's also a Net News searching & subscription facility at

Send "help" in the body of the message for more info.

Some of the attached references were followed up by journal articles, but I
include them all for completeness.

Subject: Simple databases available for rendering
Status: RO


Hello fellow global illumination fans.  This is a note about
some simple databases to test rendering that I have put
together.  They are in the spirit of (but not quite as neat as)
the ray tracing test scenes put together by Eric Haines.
They are greyscale and diffuse and mostly quadrilaterals,
so expect something designed for ease of use in arbitrary renderers.
Anyway, if you use them and experience any problems, please
let me know by email.

============================================================================

Some sample databases for rendering calculations are available
by anonymous ftp.  There are eleven scenes each with a sample
image from a particular viewpoint.  Ten of the scenes have all
quadrilaterals, and one also has a sphere.  The scenes are achromatic.
Nine are all diffuse, one has a specular surfaces, and one has 
a glass object.

The scenes range in complexity from an empty room with six quadrilaterals,
to a 100 room scene with 41800 quadrilaterals.

More scenes may be supplied later.  If you want other types of scenes
or need help converting our geom files to your own format,
contact Peter Shirley at shirley@cs.indiana.edu.

The data is available via anonymous ftp at
moose.cs.indiana.edu (129.79.254.191) in pub/RW5.  This
directory contains a README file and several subdirectories (one of
which has compressed tar files for the other directories).

The README file is attached at the end of this note.

Peter Shirley
shirley@cs.indiana.edu


======================== README file =======================================

This file contains descriptions of what is in the various scene
description files.   The files do not make reference to viewing
parameters, but some example images produced using Monte Carlo
are supplied for reference.  The scenes are further documented in
some postscript files in subdirectory "doc":

scenes0to5.ps    :   scenes 0 through 5.
scenes6to8.ps    :   scenes 6 through 8.
scenes9to10.ps   :   scenes 9 and 10.
tableAndChair.ps :   table and chair models used in test scenes
viewing.ps       :   viewing system for sample images.

The sample images of the files are in tiff, ppm, jpeg, and SGI rgb form.
These are in subdirectories tiff, ppm, jpeg, and rgb.  Scene0 is
computed to 18 levels of reflection and the rest are calculated to 5
levels of reflection.

The geometry files are in subdirectory geometry.

The directories doc, geometry, jpeg, ppm, rgb, and tiff are available
in tar form in subdirectory tarfiles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
MATERIAL PROPERTIES

All surfaces are supplied with achromatic information only.  Each
surface is one of four material types: diffuse, specular,
transparent-dielectric, or diffuse-luminaire.  This is of course a gross
simplification, but is intended for ease of use.  For diffuse
and specular surfaces, a simple reflectance is given.  For dielectric,
a refractive index is given.  For luminaires, a diffuse reflectance
and an emitted radiance is given.  For example, here are the notations
for the material types:

d 0.3      // diffuse surface, reflectance 0.3
s 0.3      // specular surface, reflectance 0.3
t 1.4      // transparent dielectric, refractive index 1.4 
l 0.3 0.8  // diffuse luminaire, reflectance 0.3, emitted radiance 0.8 

The emitted radiance can be considered to be a spectral
radiance at a particular wavelength.  The values have been chosen
so that most of the radiance values in the scene will be between 0 and 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SURFACE GEOMETRY

Two basic geometries are supported: quadrilaterals and spheres.
Quads follow the right-handed vertex ordering convention andu are planer.
A diffuse quad with reflectance 0.2 and vertices on the XY plane with
a surface normal facing along the +Z axis is:

q  0 0 0  1 0 0  1 1 0  0 1 0  d 0.2
^  ^      ^      ^      ^      ^
|  |      |      |      |      |
|  |      |      |      |      diffuse reflectance = 0.2
|  |      |      |      vertex 4 = (0, 1, 0)
|  |      |      vertex 3 = (1, 1, 0)
|  |      vertex 2 = (1, 0, 0)
|  vertex 1 = (0, 0, 0)
quad

A sphere is supplied with a center and a radius.  For example,
a sphere with center at the origin and a radius of 1.2 that is a
dielectric with refractive index 1.6 is:

s  0 0 0  1.2  t 1.6

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE0  (all quads-- scene0.geom)

There are several files that are based on the simple room geometry in
this file.  This is an axis-aligned
room with rectangular walls and a square floor/ceiling.  The room is 
three meters high, and six meters on a side.  In scene0, all surfaces are
emitters with emitted radiance 0.25 and diffuse reflectance 0.5.
This is a convenient debugging scene because the final radiance of
all points on all surfaces is  0.5 = 0.25(1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + ...).
Note that this is true for all surface geometries that have this
material properties, so more complex scenes can be built-up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE1 (all quads-- scene1.geom)

This is the same geometry as scene 0, but the floor and walls (bottom,
left, right, front, back) are diffuse reflectors with reflectivity 0.5,
and the ceiling is a diffuse emitter with reflectance 0.5 and emitted
radiance 0.5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE2 (all quads-- scene2.geom)

This is the same room as scenes 0 and 1, but all surfaces are diffuse
reflectors with reflectance 0.5, except the floor which is specular
with reflectivity 0.5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE3 (all quads-- scene3.geom)

The same room geometry as scenes 0-2, but the walls and ceiling are
diffuse reflectors with reflectivity 0.7, the floor is a diffuse
reflector with reflectivity 0.3, and a one meter square light fixture
has been added with center (0, 2.8, 0) and emitted radiance 18..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE4 (all quads-- scene4.geom)

The same as scene3, but the fixture is 0.1 meters across and has 
emitted radiance 1800.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE5 (quads with one sphere-- scene5.geom)

The same as scene3, but has a glass sphere with refractive index 1.5,
center (0, 1, 0) and radius 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE6  (all quads-- scene6.geom)

Scene 3 with a table and chairs added.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE7  (all quads-- scene7.geom)

Scene 4 with a table and chairs added.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE8  (all quads-- scene8.geom)

Four lights, 36 chairs, and a table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE9  (all quads-- scene9.geom)

100 interconnected rooms hovering in black space, with 100 lights.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE10  (all quads-- scene10.geom)

100 interconnected rooms hovering in black space, with 100 lights and
100 table-chair sets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TABLE (all diffuse quads-- table.quad)

The table is all diffuse quads with reflectance 0.3.
(there are no lights in this file)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAIR (all diffuse quads-- chair.geom)

The chair is all diffuse quads with reflectance 0.3.
(there are no lights in this file)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TABLE AND CHAIRS (all diffuse quads-- tableAndChairs.geom).

The table and 4 chairs is all diffuse quads with reflectance 0.3.
(there are no lights in this file)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIEWING

The viewing system for the examples is shown in viewing.ps.  
The parameters are lookfrom (viewer eye position), lookat point
(lookat minus lookfrom is the gaze vector), the view-up vector vup
(vup is not necessarily perpendicular to the gaze vector).  The
vertical field-of-view (vfov) is specified in degrees.

I'm appending a partial table of contents of the book below, so you
can see what topics are addressed.  This is a very abbreviated list,
intended mostly to convey the flavor of the topics.  If you would like 
to donate one or more exercises, I'd love to see them.  Of course, you

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CLOUD VOLUME FILES (subdirectory volume)

The two files contain the same 3D cloud in 2 different resolutions.
A 'cloud' has been modeled as a density distribution in 3D space,
i.e. as a 3D voxel matrix. Each voxel of the cloud represents a 'density'
value within the range [0,255]. There are different ways to interpret
this 'density': some authors use it as material density between a lower
density (usually vacuum, empty space, air, etc.) and a higher density
(usually vapor), whereas others employ a a model using number of particles
per unit space. In any case, both models work fine and the parameters can be
easily converted between the two methods, so this will not be a real problem.

Both files have a 12 bytes long header -- which must be skipped -- followed
by the actual cloud data. Both clouds are identical in their structure
and differ only in the 'level of detail': the file cloud.64 contains
64 x 64 x 64 unsigned chars:
    <12 bytes header> <64 x 64 x 64 bytes of cloud data>

the file cloud.128 contains 128 x 128 x 128 unsigned chars. 
    <12 bytes header> <64 x 64 x 64 bytes of cloud data>

NOTE: in order to save space, files have been compressed using the
UNIX 'compress' command. In order to receive the original data copy
both files cloud.64.Z and cloud.128.Z fiert, and then use the UNIX 'uncompress'
command on your local copies.

DO NOT FORGET TO CHANGE the ftp-mode to 'binary' BEFORE copying the compressed

Then I (Eric Haines) added:

This is the best one out there (since there currently aren't any others).  I
definitely recommend it (me, biased?  just because I carpool with one of the
authors and went to school with the other?).  However, there are two more
books soon to come out:

    Francois Sillion & Claude Puech, "Radiosity and Global Illumination,"
	approx 250 pages, Morgan Kaufmann, ISBN 1-55860-277-1, $49.95,
	to come out Spring 1994

I don't know a lot about this one other than it appears to be somewhat like
Cohen & Wallace's, more of a theory-based book with practical matters covered
in general terms.

The other is:

    Ian Ashdown, "Radiosity: A Programmer's Perspective," John Wiley & Sons,
	to come out Summer 1994 (by SIGGRAPH)

Ian's book sounds exciting, as it's meant to be a hands on book with code.

The 512-page book will include 7,500+ lines of documented C++ source code for
a fully functional and mostly platform-independent radiosity renderer.
Approximately 1,200 lines of C and C++ are used to provide a user interface
for Microsoft Windows in 16-bit and 32-bit versions (Windows 3.1 and
Win32/Windows NT).

  I make it very clear in my book that the industry bible is "Radiosity and
Realistic Image Synthesis".  What I have attempted to provide is an
inexpensive ($40) radiosity testbed for personal desktop computers.  In it I
have implemented a standalone 3-D viewing system with Gouraud shading, color
dithering, gamma correction and so forth (Chapters 3 and 4), a review of form
factor determination methods and three implementations (hemi-cube, cubic
tetrahedron and ray casting), a review of iterative techniques for solving the
radiosity equation (with an implementation of progressive refinement
radiosity, including the ambient lighting term and positive overshooting),
meshing techniques (with an adaptive subdivision implementation), and a review
of other radiosity techniques.  Despite the title, the underlying mathematics
are complete and self-contained.

  The appendices are still in question - I may not have room to include them
in the book (although they will be on the accompanying diskette).  Eigenvector
radiosity is still partly under development.  It presents an efficient direct
method (as opposed to an iterative method such as Southwell relaxation) using
eigenvalues and eigenvectors for solving the radiosity equation.

                     5th Eurographics Workshop on Rendering

                           Call for Contributions

                     Darmstadt, Germany  13-15 June 1994

*******************************************************************************

Aims and Scope: Following four successful workshops (Rennes-1990,
Barcelona-1991, Bristol-1992, Paris-1993) we announce the fifth workshop on
rendering techniques. In the recent years the workshop has been well 
established as a major international forum in exchanging experience
and knowledge between people from universities, research and industry 
interested in the different aspects of rendering techniques.

Main topics include (but are not restricted to):
   - Radiosity
   - Ray tracing
   - Illumination models
   - Colour, texture
   - Sampling, filtering, anti-aliasing
   - Parallel solutions for rendering

Two special themes of this workshop are:
   - Illumination & rendering of participating media (volume 
     objects, clouds, ...)
   - Rendering of architectural & CAD models (illumination simulation,
     real-time rendering, walkthroughs, handling of large datasets, ...)

We encourage also papers describing on-going research and providing
new techniques, perspectives and applications in the field. Discussions
and evaluation of current techniques and future trends greatly 
contribute to the attractivity of the workshop. Thus, the presentation of 
the papers to the plenum will be followed by a discussion introduced by an
expert of the field. Internationally renowned speakers from research and
industry will also present invited papers.

Contributions: Authors are requested to send five copies of
an extended abstract (4-6 pages) or a full unpublished paper (ca. 10 pages)
to the workshop office. Poster presentations are also possible.
Please include your telephone, fax and e-mail address. Submissions missing the
deadline will still be considered, but with a lower priority.
Full versions of all papers will be distributed among the participants as
workshop proceedings. Invitations to submit revised versions of the full
papers to be published as a book will depend on the quality of the
contributions.  In order to better compare results of different techniques,
a set of test databases will be made available via anonymous ftp.

Schedule: 5 April    1994  Submission deadline 
          5 May      1994  Notification of acceptance for presentation
          30 May     1994  Full-paper deadline for the workshop proceedings
          13-15 June 1994  Workshop

Organization: The workshop is organized by the Fraunhofer Institute for
Computer Graphics in Darmstadt in association with Eurographics. The fee
will be about 300 DM for EG-members (and 425 DM for non-members),
including lunch, coffee breaks, and workshop proceedings. As social event
we plan a visit in Heidelberg. A presentation of the research group of 
Darmstadt (with three different institutions and about 130 staff researchers
in Germany, USA and Portugal) including demos and information about
activities will also be organized.

Subject: search for complex scenes
Date: Mon, 18 Apr 1994 08:19:46 +0200
Status: R

Dear all!

We are currently developing a very promising radiosity method for VERY 
complex scenes, i.e. for a huge number of patches (over 1 million), which 
shall behave linearly with the number of patches. Unfortunately, we are 
very bad artists and unable to model "nice" and complex scenes for testing 
and demonstrating purposes. So this mail is to ask all of you:

***************************************************************************
*Do you know of any available scene descriptions for our purposes? How can*
*we access them? Do you yourself happen to have such scenes? Would you be *
*willing to offer us their use? Or do you have any ideas, who else might  * 
*be able to help us?                                                      *
***************************************************************************

We are a completely non-commercial institute and need the scenes only for 
testing/publishing purposes for scientific journals/proceedings. We will, 
of course, always acknowledge the origin of any scene description we use.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: survey for rendering workshop
Status: R


At the 1992 workshop in Bristol, Michael Cohen made an informal
survey on the degree to which rendering problems are solved.  For
the 1994 workshop in Darmstadt we are doing the survey again (along
with a few additional questions).  We hope this will provide some
qualitative derivative information about where rendering is going,
and help stimulate discussion at the workshop.  Feel free to copy
this to other rendering researchers (this is an informal survey).

Please answer the following questions and mail your response
to shirley@cs.indiana.edu.

Subject: Re:  survey for rendering workshop
Status: R

Hi Pete,

Here's my survey.  I hope you'll distribute the results, as I won't make
it again to this year's workshop.  (Damned skinflint government!)

1) Define image synthesis

The synthesis of images.  OK, OK -- the creating of images synthetically.
No, wait.  I got it!  The imaging of synthetic environments.

I would define image synthesis as light and camera simulation in a
computer model of a (more or less) physical environment.

2) What are the key issues that are still unanswered or not answered well
   in image synthesis?  Rate each issue as unsolved (0) to solved (5).

3    (a) dealing with environmental complexity

2    (b) dealing with human perceptual issues

2    (c) rendering caustics

3    (d) dealing with color

3    (e) parallelization

3    (f) local reflection models
 
4    (g) the hidden surface problem

4    (h) mapping results to display devices

2    (i) participating media

2    (j) time/space complexity of image synthesis algorithms

2    (k) implementation issues for image synthesis


3) To what extent (0-5) do you agree with the following statement: "the MAIN
   problem remaining in image synthesis is simply that we cannot model,
   with sufficient detail, the environments we want to create images of".

Cannot or will not?  I'd agree with the assertion that most people are
unwilling to spend the time at it, but I wouldn't put it outside the
realm of possibility.  I guess I'd have to agree at level 3 with the
statement as written.


4) How far has the image synthesis field come in solving the image
   synthesis problem? (0-5).

About 2.

5) How far does the graphics community as a whole think the field has come
   in solving the image synthesis problem? (0-5).

Probably 3 or 4.

6) What is the most important problem to work on in image synthesis?

Creating a standard scene description language for physically-based
rendering.  Renderers should be a commodity, and we need some kind
of standard to make this happen.  RIB is not it, nor is Inventor,
or any of the many other non-physical description languages out there.
Geometry is well-understood and people generally agree on how to
describe surfaces and volumes, but materials and light behavior
have so far been treated with rampant disrespect.

7) How many years have you worked in image synthesis?

Almost 10.

8) Additional comments

There is a new project being organized by a couple of guys in Australia
that could lead to a very powerful public-domain rendering environment,
if we are willing to pitch in and help.  Contact Llew Mason and Matt West
at "mwest@tartarus.uwa.edu.au" for more information.

Have fun in Darmstadt (sniff!).

Hello "globillum" (global illumination mailing list) readers.

I'm the keeper of the "globillum" mailing list, in case I've never introduced
myself.  The globillum mailing list itself will now be kept on a computer
here at Carnegie Mellon, not at Berkeley, where it was located previously.
The new address to mail a message to everyone in the group is:

    globillum@cs.cmu.edu

and the address to send messages to have your address changed,
added, or removed from the "globillum" list is:

    globillum-request@cs.cmu.edu

If you use the old Berkeley address (globillum@miro.berkeley.edu), it might
stop working next week, since they're reconfiguring machines there.


While I'm on the subject of mailing lists, would one of you please please
please be willing to maintain the mailing list in the future?  Although
it doesn't take much work, I haven't had the time to do a very good job
the past few years.  To volunteer, please email me.

Hi All,

Well, it's getting on towards Siggraph, and those of us who attend usually
try to get together for lunch at some point to talk about what we're up
to and what we wish we were doing instead.  Since I'm going this year,
I thought I'd start the ball rolling and suggest a time we could meet.

How about Wednesday, July 27th, around noon?

To avoid network chaos, please send mail to me directly and I will
collect votes.  If you can meet on Wednesday and want this time rather
than some other, let me know.  If you can't meet on Wednesday but want
to meet, please write and suggest which other days would work for you.
If you don't want to meet or aren't available for lunch during the week
or if you aren't coming to Siggraph this year, there is no need to
respond to this mail.

Please send your responses to <GJWard@lbl.gov>.  I will try to stick
to the Wednesday date even if some of you can't make it, but if there
is a majority of votes for some other day then I will change it and
announce the change in a subsequent e-mail to the group.

Regardless of the outcome, we will have to post the exact location
and time of the meeting on the bulletin board at the conference,
since we won't know where to go until we're there.  (Someone tell
me if they have information on how to book a room in advance.)

-----------------------
In other news, I've been working on yet another file format for scene
information.  (This one's different -- really!)  I was asked to
develop a standard for light fixture geometry by members of the
Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) Computer Committee, and
I decided to make the exercise a little more general so that the
new format would be broadly applicable.  The chief advantage over
other formats is that it is physically valid and it comes with
a standard parser that makes writing translators a breeze.  This
parser only gives you those entities you know how to handle, e.g.
it converts spheres into polygons if you can't handle spheres.

I have set up an ftp site for the parser, and included several models
and an object library, all taken from Radiance.  If you have Mosaic, you
can access the URL "file://hobbes.lbl.gov/www/mgf/HOME.html".  If you
don't have Mosaic, use anonymous ftp to hobbes.lbl.gov and check out
the README file in the /www/mgf/ directory.

Wednesday at noon is ok with me.
If that doesn't work out, I suggest Friday at 11:45.
My experience with SIGGRAPH is that mid-week, while the exhibition is open,
is when things are most hectic.  By Friday, things have calmed down a lot,
and it's mostly the hard-core people who are still around.  But Weds.
would be fine with me.

I really like it at Penn, but my husband just finished a PhD in history and
found a job at the University of New Hampshire (~50 miles from Boston).  I just
accepted a position in the architecture school at MIT for the fall.  It will
be hard to leave here, as I'm just starting to feel settled, but the MIT job
seems like an ideal solution to our two-body problem.

See you soon.  I hope your siggraph preparations are not too frantic!

Wednesday noon meeting time, one vote against and (I assume) many abstainers.

So, Wednesday it will be.  We will post something on the bulletin board

"Globillum".  Please come if you can, and bring whatever show and tell
materials you want to share with the group.

Now that Siggraph is over, I am about to send out the results of the
terminology survey.  There are two loose ends I would like to clear
up first.  Any help is appreciated.

1) Does anybody have a recent list of CR keywords and categories?  Those
   are those things you see at the start of many papers-- e.g. "I.3.7
   [Computer Graphics: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism".

2) If your mother-tongue is not english, is there a direct (or used)
   equivalent to the following terms?

                       rendering
	     realistic rendering
        photorealistic rendering
                       image synthesis

Hello. Enclosed are the (long overdue!) results of my survey on which
(if any) of the following terms were preferred to describe making
computed images that relate to how things look in the real world (I
don't want to say "realistic :^}).  I make no explicit suggestions of
what this survey is useful for, but I hope everyone will remember how
much easier it is to write a paper now that we all have the
same term for "radiance".

Many people thought rendering was the same as "scan conversion"
or rasterizing.  Others thought that rendering and image
synthesis are synonymous.  It is clear that there is not
agreement on what rendering means.  It is also clear that
some think that the "realistic" is implicit in "image synthesis".
One thing is for sure-- there is no global agreement!  

Thanks to all that responded.

there were three "other term" votes that also expressed a preference among the

           photosimulation
           virtual image
           idealistic image synthesis
           pseudorealistic image synthesis

============================================================================

Here are some translations of the english terms into other languages:

>From Christophe Schlick (French):
		rendering	=	rendu
    realistic   rendering	=	rendu realiste
 photorealistic rendering	=	rendu photorealiste
		image synthesis =	synth\`ese d'images
    realistic   image synthesis =	synth\`ese d'images r\'ealistes
 photorealistic image synthesis = 	synth\`ese d'images photor\'ealistes


>From Wolfgang Stuerzlinger (German):
(photo-)realistic   = (Photo-)realistisch                           no Problem
rendering           = leisten, abgeben, wiedergeben, machen, ...
	retranslated: service, give, interpret/translate, make      :-(
images synthesis    = Bild Synthese = Bild Generierung
        retranslated: picture/image synthesis/generation            better
                                                                    alternative

>From Per Christensen (Danish):
most of the words have direct translations:
  realistic = realistisk
  photorealistic = foto-realistisk  (this seem like a rather contrived
                                     word, even in English)
  image synthesis = billed-syntese  (this is commonly used)
Now, as for "rendering" I don't know how to translate it  (I've heard
the word used/abused untranslated by CG people in Denmark -- where 
"people" includes myself :-) ).

============================================================================

I also give the ACM CR classifications that are relevant (those crazy
numbers and letters at the beginning of siggraph papers...thanks to
Pat Hanrahan and Andrew Glassner for sending me these-- they were so hard
to get hold of that I will resend them in a separate message).  There
are some useful categories related to quadrature, integral equations, etc.

   You can tell from the title...

RADIOSITY AND GLOBAL ILLUMINATION by Sillion and Puech:
   Defines "image synthesis" as the "computation of a picture" in the
   inroduction.  This is consistent with the first two books.

AN INTRODUCTION TO RAY TRACING ed. by Glassner
   Uses both "realistic and photorealistic" in preface, and
   uses "image syntesis" in the intro which is defined to be
   "creating a 2-D picture of a 3-D world.  Rendering is used
   in some places in the book as well.

Subject: New version of MGF
Status: R

Fellow Globillumers,

About a month and a half ago, I announced a new format called MGF (for
Materials and Geometry Format) for exchanging scene data.  I have since
updated this standard to version 0.7 (still in prerelease) and announced
it to the world via comp.graphics and sci.engr.lighting.  If you have
seen those announcements already, then you may want to skip the rest of
this, but I realize that a lot of people either don't get network news
or suffer from information overload and don't read it regularly.

To remind you, MGF was developed by myself with help from Rob Shakespeare,
Ian Ashdown and Holly Rushmeier.  It will probably end up being the standard
for representing light fixture geometry as part of a new IES (Illuminating
Engineering Society) standard for luminaire data, but that's still down
the road aways.  In the meantime, I am trying to get people to play with
the parser and scene/object library to work out problems in the specification
and the code, and in hopes of simplifying and promoting data exchange between
us research types.

Here is a reprint of a recent posting...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Announcing MGF:  Materials and Geometry Format


Here we have yet another proposal for a standard graphics scene
representation, but with a few notable differences:

	1) The material descriptions are physically-based and
		therefore usable for lighting simulation:  radiosity
		and ray-tracing methods for global illumination.

	2) The package includes an ANSI-C parser that makes writing
		a translator to any native format quick and painless.
		It also includes a nice library of objects and scenes
		culled from the Radiance distribution.

	3) Use of the parser and library is free.

The language was designed by the author and some other lighting
and computer graphics experts/enthusiasts.  It includes what it needs
to include plus a little bit.  It is by no means the ultimate scene
description, and future attempts to improve the format must be weighed
against the benefits of keeping things simple.  Also, enhancements to
the standard will be made in such a way that they do not place new
demands on the programmers who support it.  This will be accomplished
by updating the parser along with the standard, so each programmer
need only support those entities s/he knows how to translate.  The
parser will translate the rest.

Some other basics about MGF:

	o It is a compact, human-readable ASCII format
	o It's syntax permits it to be embedded in TCL (I think)
	o It is strictly boundary-representation (for now)
	o It is mostly polyhedral, but supports a few conics
	o Vertices may be named, may have normals, and may be shared
	o Colors and materials may also be named and put in libraries
	o It supports full-spectral colors and arbitrary basis functions
	o It supports one-sided and two-sided surfaces
	o It supports rigid-body transformations and instancing
	o Materials may reflect, transmit and emit light

To pick up the parser by anonymous ftp, look in the /www/mgf directory
of hobbes.lbl.gov (128.3.12.38), or from WWW access the URL:

	ftp://hobbes.lbl.gov/www/mgf/HOME.html

(By the way, we'd welcome links to other WWW sites, as we're isolated at
the moment.)

Subject: A remark on LAMBERT's law
To: globillum@cs.cmu.edu
Date: Mon, 5 Sep 1994 09:32:02 +0200 (MET DST)
Status: RO



Dear globillumers,

last  week  I've  got the SIGGRAPH-CD, and among the papers one
called

           Generalization of Lambert's Reflectance Model

by  Michael Oren and Shree K. Nayar. In this paper it is shown,
that  the Lambert law (the way it is used in Computer Graphics)
does not correctly reproduce real diffuse surfaces (like clay).
That's   right,   and  I  agree.  Based  on  this  knowledge  a
complicated generalization somewhat analogous to the microfacet
illumination model is involved.

I believe, there is no need to complicate a good and simple law
further,  because  the Lambert law as used in physics is right.
However  it  is  misinterpreted  in  computer  graphics (and in
thermal  engineering  -  see  Siegel  and  Howards  book  about
Radiative  Heat  Transfer  -  too).  I  intended  to  publish a
(complete) paper concerning the misinterpretation and misuse of
good  old Lambert in CG. However I think it is time to make the
uncomplete  pre-version available for discussion. (This version
was  published  in  July  this  year  in  Rostocker  Informatik
Berichte(1994) 15.) The paper "Illumination along convex edges"
and the pictures can be ftp-ed from

                 ftp.informatik.uni-rostock.de
under   /pub/graphics/edge_illu.ps.Z  and  edge_pictures.tar.Z.
(The  subdir  is nearly empty because of a ftp-server-crashdown
last week.)

Although  the  final picture of "my" ;-) Lambert interpretation
is  missing,  all  important  facts are included (I hope so). I
know that the facts are somewhat exotic for most CG people, and
it  may  be hard to believe in this. Just read it, and maybe we
can have an interesting discussion about it.

OK, I'm anxious for the responses.
Greetings.
Nico                     (nic@informatik.uni-rostock.de)

Subject: Radiosity history
Status: RO

Paul Heckbert asked me to forward this bit of radiosity history and personal
flaming on my part to globillum. It provides evidence that we are not the first
to travel this way ...

>> I never did find a copy of Moon and Spencer's 1948 "Lighting Design,"
>> which has the first-ever examples of synthetic images created using

> That's a great bit of trivia that I never heard before! Please share

Actually, I included it as an anecdote in an upcoming article entitled
"Radiosity Online: A Bibliography" that is scheduled to be published in
the next issue of Computer Graphics. I also discuss it briefly in my
forthcoming book. Neither discussion, however, gives all the details.
For the record, then:

The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America has had a long
tradition of publishing the best papers from its annual conferences in
the Journal of the IES (formerly "Illuminating Engineering"). While most
of these papers hold little interest these days, there are still a few
gems awaiting rediscovery.

One of these papers is:

  O'Brien, P. F. and J. A. Howard 1959. "Predetermination of Luminances
  by Finite Difference Equations," Illuminating Engineering 14(4):209-
  218 (April).

whose abstract reads:

  Luminous flux transfer in an enclosure may be described by a system of
  linear simultaneous equations which are a finite difference
  representation of the Fredholm integral equation. Many techniques of
  numerical analysis, including analogue and digital computers, are
  applicable to the solution of these equations. The development of this
  method for the analysis and synthesis of lighting systems is now being
  prosecuted actively on a world-wide basis. Truncation errors, an
  inherent feature of the finite difference equations, can be reduced to
  acceptable levels. Additional numerical methods need to be explored for
  applicability to the analysis of lighting systems.

The paper is interesting in its own right as an early investigation of
the radiosity method. The references, however, are even more interesting.
The authors note, for example, that the radiosity equation (which they
refer to as simply "the fundamental equation of radiant flux transfer")
was first presented by Ziro Yamauti in 1926 and H. Buckley in 1927. There
are also interesting papers such as:

  Centeno, M. and A. Zagustin 1953. "Interflectance in Two Dimensions,"
  Universidad Central de Venezula, Caracas.

Radiosity in flatland, perhaps?

Perhaps the best part of O'Brien and Howard's paper, however, is the
ensuing discussion. The IESNA has had an equally  long tradition of
publishing the discussions and questions from the floor that follow a
paper's presentation. These discussions are sometimes more valuable than
the paper itself. For example, Dr. Domina Eberle Spencer had this to say
about O'Brien and Howard's paper:

    The names of O'Brien and Howard are comparatively new to the IES.
  Their contribution in applying the analogue method to a solution of the
  basic integral equations of interflection theory by use of the finite
  difference approach is valuable. However, perhaps due to their
  comparatively brief association with the Society, they have fallen into
  several conceptual errors.
    They say that the "numerical method ... has been developed in the
  lighting literature only recently." May I remind the authors that nearly
  thirty years ago Moore and Manning and White were applying such methods
  to just such problems, and in 1934, the finite difference or numerical
  approach to the interflection problem was treated in Professor Higbie's
  excellent book. The new thing about the numerical method is not the
  method, but the proficiency with which it has recently been applied.
    The authors also suggests that synthesis of a lighting system is a
  new idea. The word "synthesis" as applied to illuminating engineering is
  perhaps new, but the procedure is not. The first application that
  Professor Moon and I made of the interflection method was to finding
  what methods could be used to synthesize the optimum lighting
  environment. We found that for nearly all shapes of rooms, the best way
  to satisfy the 3:1 adaptation brightness ratio was to make the entire
  ceiling a source of light. This, as far as we are concerned, was the
  beginning of luminous ceilings. The practical development of luminous
  ceilings has merely been a long struggle to realize the synthetic
  photographs which were exhibited by Professor Moon and myself at the
  1946 National Technical Conference. Subsequently, we wrote an entire
  book on the subject, which the authors cite in their references.

Dr. Spencer continues on, ending with:

  ... If the authors undertake the very commendable task of solving
  interflection problems with semi-specular surfaces or containing fog,
  they would do well to think enough about photometric concepts to
  understand the difference between the visually meaningful concept of
  brightness and the visually meaningless concept of emittance.

The radiosity equation and Fredholm integrals of the second kind in 1926,
synthetic photographs in 1946, semispecular surfaces and participating
media in 1959 ... we should heed Dr. Spencer's admonishment to O'Brien
and Howard that "... they have fallen into several conceptual errors."
Until we conduct a thorough investigation of the illumination engineering
literature, we should be careful about saying who developed what! Even
better, we may discover long-forgotten ideas that are practical with the
aid of modern "analogue and digital computers."

I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Spencer at the 1993 IESNA Annual
Conference in Houston, Texas. She told me how she and Dr. Parry Moon
created their synthetic photographs. In the absence of computers, they
calculated the form factor and luminance of each patch by hand, cut out
paper squares from Munsell color charts and pasted them together to form
their images, which were then photographed. These photographs were
reproduced in:

  Moon, P. and D. E. Spencer 1948. Lighting Design, Addison-Wesley,
  Cambridge, MA.

The framed originals, Dr. Spencer told me, still hang in her office at
the Department of Mathematics, University of Conneticut.

In these days of instant communications via the Internet (hah!), we tend
to forget that there remains an astounding amount of information and
ideas available only on paper. More often than not, this information is
held in storage by a few university libraries as back issues of obscure
journals. This is *not good*.

For those convinced that radiosity research began in 1984, consider this
isolated quote from a paper written in 1943:

  The result is an application of the Hilbert-Schmidt theory of integral
  equations, which leads to the interesting conclusion that the
  [radiosity equation] kernel has an infinite number of eigenvalues,
  associated with which is one eigenfunction in the form of a hyperbolic
  cosine and a set of trigonmetric eigenfunctions. The solution of the
  inhomogeneous equation is written by means of Schmidt's formula, and it
  is found that for engineering purposes all the terms but the first can
  be neglected.

The paper in question is:

  Moon, P. 1943. "New Methods of Calculating Illumination," Journal of the
  Optical Society of America 33(2):115-122 (February)

where the above is added almost as an afterthought. (Does anyone know what
this means?) There are no less than 48 references, of which only one is
familiar -- Lambert's seminal treatise on photometry from 1760!

Consider also that the Russian Academy of Sciences has been publishing
important treatises on photometry and radiometry -- in Russian -- for over
a century. I think we have a lot of reading to do ...

Subject: A remark on LAMBERT's law
Status: R

I think we have a semantic problem here. A law (like Lambert's Law, or the ideal
gas law, for example) only applies to whatever obeys it. If it looks like
a tautology, it is because it is one. An ideal gas IS a gas which obeys
the ideal gas law, a diffuse reflector IS a reflector which obeys Lambert's
law (at least according to most optics text, see eg Born & Wolf), and therefore
one should not speak of a "non-Lambertian diffuse reflector", unless one 
redefines what "diffuse" means, or (worse) rewrite Lambert's law but keeps
the same name.

Ian Ashdown has sent me a copy of his note (broadcast on globillum)
concerning the history of radiative transfer applied to illuminating
engineering.  I might add the following.

1) Moon and Spenser book "Lighting Design" is a rarity but is availble
from University Microfilms International, Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI.  I
got my copy of "Lighting Design" from UMI, and although it is a xerox
copy of the original it is quite serviceable.

2) A study of this book, and papers that Moon and Spencer published
in The Franklin Journal, shows that their approach was to approximate
the kernal that resulted from a statement, in integral equation form,
of the radiative transfer problem.  They didn't like, nor use, the
finite element method applied to this problem.

3) The first extensive use of the finite element method to the radiatvie
transfer problem in lighting was, indeed, O'Brien.  He wrote of it as
the "network" method, lifting an analogy from circuits.  His work first
appeared in CIE publications and in JOSA in the early 1950's.

4) To be blunt, many of us in the lighting engineering industry wondered
what all the fuss was about when the computer graphics community started
talking about "radiosity".  This (silly) word is superfluous, since there
has long been international agreement about terms needed in radiometric
and photometric work.  The ISO has the (individual governments' ceded)
authority to establish such vocabulary.  It looks to the CIE (international
lighting commission) to do this.  The latest edition of the International
Lighting Vocabulary is now available. Folks at NIST know how to get ahold
of it.

5) The finite element formulation of the raditive transfer problem has been
used by lighting engineers for almost 50 years to solve the practical
engineering problems that they have faced:  typically and commonly to
predict the average illuminance a lighting system produces in a room;
less typically and only recently more common, to predict the illuminance
a lighting system produces at a point in a room.  This formulation has
been used to design a lighting system, i.e. synthesize, not just to
analyze.  The advent of the PC produced early versions of software that
increased the number of elements so that reasonably useful "synthetic
pictures" could be produced.  The method wasn't changed, just the size
of the problem.  This took place in 1982.

6) Concern with the (recent) history of technology is perhaps the fooling
away of time by scholars.  Perhaps.  This point of view might be supported
by G. Ward's recent musings about why isn't anyone really using "radiosity".
For any one that really needs pictures (to show a client, to solve a 
lighting problem, and in general to reduce uncertainty) which are photo-
graphic in their realism and accurate in their numbers, program like
Radiance appear to by the industry's choice.  If such pictures aren't
needed, then other software IS used by the industry, and it is based
on radiative transfer.  So knowing our history might just be a (small) part
of knowing our discipline well; and as Ian suggested might hold information
and techniques that may have a new life on modern computing hardware.

P.S.

I believe the deepest thinker (not tinkerer) in radiative transfer was
Rudolf Preisendorfer.  His book "Radiative Transfer on Discrete Spaces"
is difficult, profound and insightful.  His formalisms establish an
approach to practical problems that put our work on firm mathematical
and physical ground.  It was published by Pergamon Press; now out of
print, but available from  UMI.  Rudy started this work back in the
1950's when he was wrestling with the radiative transfer problems that
arise in predicting light levels, contrasts, and visibilities under water.
He was a Scripps for a very long time.  Highly recommended.

Subject: New free radiosity program

   I'm a recently graduated mechanical engineering student from Spain. As
 part of my end of studies project I have developed a radiosity program
 with the following main characteristics:

     -Monte Carlo integration to compute diffuse illumination: This permits
    to have refracted shadows, specular and diffuse reflections, blurry
    reflections, translucency, texture mapping and any geometry of light
    sources.

     -Adaptive subdivision: Objects with big radiosity gradients inside
    are dynamically subdivided during the radiosity process.

     -Ray tracing: A postprocess of ray tracing is used to calculate the
    image. The main characteristics of the algorithm used are:

        -Depth of field.
        -Stochastic anti-aliasing.
        -Optional 3D glasses stereo view.

     -Acceleration techniques: Three different user selectable techniques
    are incorporated:
        -Binary Object Partitioning
        -Adaptive voxel subdivision (with optimal coordinate system selection)
        -Z-Buffer for first ray acceleration

     -Geometry input: It reads 3D Studio v2 geometry files so the only
    geometric entity supported is the triangle.

     -Completely written in ANSI C: This way it may be compiled in any
    system. Actually, my work was done in a PC but I've tried and succeeded
    in compiling it with no modifications on a DEC OSF/1 and a HP-UX server.

   If anyone wants a copy of my program (it's free), please feel free to
 contact me.

   I am also planning to go to the US in November for about three months. The
 objective of my visit is to improve my english though I would like to do
 something interesting at the same time. If anyone knows some interesting
 seminar or someone who could give me a job related to 3D computer graphics
 (I'd work for free, of course), I would appreciate very much the information.

This one's in russian. It derives the double application of Stokes' theorem
to the illumination kernel (note that this is not the first time [or the
last] that this double contour form was derived).

There appears to be a German translation of this which appeared in the same
year. I say `appears' since I can't read the russian (but can read the
German), but from the looks of the formulas and the figures it seems to
treat the same material:

@Article{fock24,
  author = 	"V. A. Fock",
  title = 	"Zur Berechnung der Beleuchtungsst{\"a}rke",
  journal = 	"Zeitschrift f{\"u}r Physik",
  year = 	"1924",
  volume = 	"28",
  OPTnumber = 	"",
  pages = 	"102--113",
  month = 	"September/October",
  OPTnote = 	""
}

The earliest reference I know of with regards to the double contour
integration trick is given in a textbook(!) from 1900:

@Book{herman,
  author = 	"Robert Alfred Herman",
  title = 	"A Treatise on Geometrical Optics",
  publisher = 	"Cambridge University Press",
  year = 	"1900",
  OPTeditor = 	"",
  OPTvolume = 	"",
  OPTseries = 	"",
  OPTaddress = 	"",
  OPTedition = 	"",
  OPTmonth = 	"",
  OPTnote = 	""
}

In fact he gives as a homework exercise a computation which has been
published many years later as a unique new derivation...

He simply derives this form without any reference. From the treatment it
sounds like he considers it so self evident that he sees no need to give a
reference. Might that mean there are even earlier references to the double
contour form? I don't know, but I'd love to know.

Herman also gives a most magnificent form for the integral which I haven't
seen anyone use (yes, Michael, you still owe me a buck for loosing a bet
on this :-)):

[...]
Herman gives the following form in Exercise 15, Chaper IX of his book
Geometrical Optics (1900)
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\int_{\partial{A}_1} \int_{\partial{A}_2}
		\cos \theta_1 \cos \theta_2 \,\, dx_2\, dx_1
	& = & \int_{\partial{A}_1} \int_{\partial{A}_2}
		-\frac{(\vec{r}\cdot d\vec{x}_1)(\vec{r} \cdot d\vec{x}_2)}
			{\r^2}
\end{eqnarray*}
[...]

A most amazing little gem. It does not become infinite and is much better
behaved numerically (well, almost, it's derivative becomes infinite for
r->0). Still a remarkable form.

Not to mention the derivation of which is a most enjoyable exercise for the
interested reader. :-)  [hint: change the second application of Stokes'
theorem.]

Colleagues:
At the risk of appearing vain, and prompted by barbara's recent request
for copies of old papers by Fock and Yamaouti, may I announce that this
important method has recently been applied to non-diffuse sources?  I and
a recent graduate student of mine presented a paper at the Illuminating
Engineering Society conference in Miami Florida this past August, describing
our results.  We showed the process for replacing the area integral over
a homogenous source (homogeneous, not diffuse) with a contour integral
over its edges.

I have recently worked through the details of extending this to the
problem of replacing the double area integrals with double contour
integrals for non-diffuse sources.

In practical terms, this permits very rapid calculation of illuminances
from real area sources, such as architectural luminaires.  The IES papers
shows that the computer time investment for the new contour integral
method is approximatley 10-15 times less than the (usual) current process
of discritizing an area source and applying the so-called inverse square
cosine law to calculate the illuminances.

The double contour integration for non-diffuse sources apparently allows
the determination of non-diffuse form factors.  It isn't clear yet what
value this will have.  I do think it will lead to cleaner and much
faster approach to the non-diffuse radiative tranfer problem between
surfaces.

I found Yamauchi's paper in the Library.
(BTW, the Electrotechnical Laboratory is the root of NTT laboratories).

Here's the abstract:

The theorie of the illumination field are treated  mathematically
by using the method of vector analysis. There is proposed the
``illumination vector'' to be distinguished from the field
intensity which is the vector generally used.

The field due to a luminous source of various emissive nature is treated
in the first place and the various principal theorems to
calculate the illumination are included and rearranged systematically,
which have been heretofore by various authorities and the author.

The field in the system of interreflecting surfaces is discussed in the
second place. The fundamental integral equations are shown when
the surfaces in the system are of both diffused reflection and
transmission.

Hello folks,

We are beginning to do some work on incorporating materials with non

give me some pointers to where I might find BRDF's for some real
materials, some real data would be even better.

Any help would be greatly appreciated

I have posted a compressed tar file of BRDF measurements we took with our
imaging gonioreflectometer (see Siggraph '92 article for details) on the
anonymous ftp account of hobbes.lbl.gov in the /xfer directory.  The file
is called "brdfs.tar.Z", and make sure to set binary mode before retrieving
it.

The data format is simple.  A short information header describing the material
and measurement is followed by 5 columns.  The first column is the incident
polar angle (measured in degrees from normal).  The second column is the
incident azimuthal angle (measured in degrees from the predominant axis).
The third column is the reflected polar angle and the fourth column is
the reflected azimuthal angle.  Finally, the fifth column is the BRDF at
that point, in steradian^-1.

I make no guarantees about this data.  In particular, the data is rather
noisy and I don't expect it has better than +/-3 degree geometric accuracy
or better than +/-5% value accuracy.

Hi,

	I wonder if anyone could answer a couple of questions I have
on wavelet radiosity?  I sent this off to comp.graphics.algorithms,
but have had no response.  I would mail the authors direct, but don't
have their email addresses .... maybe people here can help?

I've been reading Steve Gortler et al's SIGGRAPH 93 paper, and Peter
Schr\"{o}der's Eurographics Workshop on Rendering 93 paper.  Here is
their (flatland) algorithm (everyone know TeX ?):

b ~ radiosity,
e ~ emitted radiosity,
g ~ gathered radiosity,
<> ~ inner product,
\phi_{i,j}, \psi_{i,j} ~ smooth and detail functions from non-standard
			 wavelet basis

Their pseudo-code:

1: <b, \phi_{L,j}> = <e, \phi_{L,j}>;
2: K = projectKernel;
3: while ( not converged )
4:   (<b, \phi_{i,j}>, <b, \psi_{i,j}>) = Pull(<b, \phi_{L,j}>);
5:   (<g, \phi_{i,j}>, <g, \psi_{i,j}>) = 
	Gather(<b, \phi_{i,j}>, <b, \psi_{i,j}>, K);
6:   <g, \phi_{L,j}> = Push (<g, \phi_{i,j}>, <g, \psi_{i,j}>);
7:   <b, \phi_{L,j}> = <g, \phi_{L,j}> + <e, \phi_{L,j}>;
8: Display ( <b, \phi_{L,j}> );

OK, so this is just repeatedly applying the projected kernel to operate on
projected radiosity vector, until convergence.
( b = e + Ke + K^2 e + K^3 e + ............ )

I have two questions:
a) why (line 7) do I keep adding the emitted radiosity to my current
radiosity estimate, surely this should be:
7:   <b, \phi_{L,j}> += <g, \phi_{L,j}>;

b) why do I have to Push everything to the finest level of the hierarchy
before continuing with the next Jacobi iteration?  I can see why I have to
do this for display, but couldn't this Pull/Push come outside of the loop?
I suspect that the answer may be that I can't simply add together
coefficients of the functions higher up the basis function hierarchy and
get the same answer as adding them together at the finest level
(\phi_{L,j}).  BUT, I can do this for the Haar basis, so I'm confused - is
this just a simple case?

question (b) is essentially:

	is
"Push(<b, \phi_{i,j}> + <g, \phi_{i,j}>, <b, \psi_{i,j}> + <g, \psi_{i,j}>)"
	equal to
"<b, \phi_{L,j}> + <g, \phi_{L,j}>"
	??????



Any help much appreciated

   radiosity estimate, surely this should be:
   7:   <b, \phi_{L,j}> += <g, \phi_{L,j}>;

This is just the rule for the evaluation of the von Neumann series:

(1-K)B=B^e -> B=\sum K^n B^e

the latter then expands into:

B:=B^e				(n=0)
B:=B^e+KB=B^e+KB^e		(n=1)
B:=B^e+KB=B^e+K(B^e+KB^e)=...	(n=2)

This has nothing to do with wavelets or anything. It's just the evaluation
of the von Neumann series.

   b) why do I have to Push everything to the finest level of the hierarchy
   before continuing with the next Jacobi iteration?  I can see why I have to
   do this for display, but couldn't this Pull/Push come outside of the loop?

The PushPull in the inner loop is only neccessary for the non-standard
realization of the operator. The reason is that the over representation
(averages on all levels of the hierarchy) needs to be consolidated before
you can continue. More intuitively, when a child somewhere in the
subdivision tree is sending out radiosity this needs to make some
contribution to the radiosity at higher (coarser) levels of averaging.
Similarly if a parent has received some irradiance than that is also
received irradiance at its children and needs to be communicated to them.

If you use the standard realization of the operator you don't have to do
this. In this case the individual levels of basis functions are linearly
independent (sometimes even orthogonal). The price you pay is that you
can't get away with O(n) links but O(n log n). The intuitive reason for the
latter is that a given receiver basis function will have to get the
contributions from all basis functions on the source (log n levels).
Whereas for the non-standard operator realization we can have a full
(albeit more or less coarse) description of what is going on at each level.
In some sense a given level acts as a proxy for all coarser levels.

It is not clear to me which one is faster, but PushPull is such a small
percentage of the overall running time that I have been reluctant to try do
away with it at the cost of intruducing links accross levels. Others have
used the standard realization but its very hard to actually compare the
cost of two rather different implementations. I prefer the simplicity of
the code for the non-standard realization (but am open to being convinced
otherwise). It would be an interesting experiment to see just what the
difference is in a single implementation so the numbers are actually
comparable.

Hope this helps.

%   This document class modifies the standard |article| class to conform to
%   the specifications for papers published in the proceedings of the annual
%   ACM Siggraph conference.
%   It sets all the necessary layout parameters and handles the differences
%   in format between a paper being submitted for blind review and a camera
%   ready copy of an accepted paper.
%   Several additional features are also provided.

%
% \section{Introduction}
%
% This document describes the |siggraph| document class, for use with \LaTeXe{}.
% It is intended as a replacement for the various versions of the old
% |siggraph.sty| file that have been floating around for years.
% It loads in the |article| class and modifies several parameters
% to comply with the layout specifications for a paper submitted to
% the ACM Siggraph conference.
% Currently, these specifications are:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item $\frac{3}{4}$ inch margins on top and sides, 1 inch margin on bottom
%   \item two column mode with 2 pica column separation
%   \item space for copyright is 4.5 pica
%   \item 9 point type on 10 point baselines
%   \item titles and section headings are bold sans serif
%   \item 1 em paragraph indentation
%   \item no page numbers
% \end{mylist}
%
% The class also allows the user to specify whether the paper is being
% submitted for blind review or as a final, camera-ready document.
% Based on this specification, it will put the appropriate information
% in the title block on the first page.
% It will also automatically generate a cover sheet for papers being
% submitted for review.
% Mechanisms are also provided to allow the user to introduce conditional
% text based on this choice.
%

% \begin{quote}
%   This is a beta release and hasn't been thoroughly tested yet. Please
%   send me any bug reports, suggestions for improvement, or other comments.
%   I will do my best to fix any problems before the Siggraph submission
%   deadline, but I make no promises.  The likelihood of my responding to
%   any given comment is directly proportional to the amount of time before
%   the deadline that the comment is received.
% \end{quote}
%
% \section{Usage}
%
% To use this class, specify
% \begin{verbatim} \documentclass{siggraph} \end{verbatim}
% at the beginning of your document.
% Any options which can be used with the |article| class can be used here,
% with the following exceptions and caveats:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item The |landscape| and |titlepage| options are disabled.
%   \item Although |twocolumn| mode is the default, the |onecolumn| option
%         is still enabled.  However, I strongly recommend against using
%         it.  Studies of printed material have shown that, for good
%	  legibility, a line of printed material
%	  should contain no more that ten to twelve words, and at the
%	  9 point type size used by this class, that limit will be greatly
%	  exceeded in one column mode.  I didn't disable the option because
%	  it has been pointed out to me that some people prefer to use
%	  it when submitting their paper for review.  If you insist on
%	  using it, I recommend increasing the type size.
%   \item By default, the document will use 9 point type, which is the
%	  size required by Siggraph for camera ready copies.  The |10pt|,
%	  |11pt|, and |12pt| options will override this.
% \end{mylist}
%
% In addition, the following options are provided:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item[|review| and |cameraready|] These specify whether the paper is
%         to be formatted as a submission for review or a camera-ready
%         final copy.  The default is |cameraready|.  The exact effects
%         of these options will be discussed later.
%   \item[|version1994|] The submission specifications may some day change, and
%         this class will therefore also need to be modified.  However,
%         we will still want older documents to maintain their appearance.
%	  This option says that the paper should be formatted according to
%	  the specifications that were in effect in 1994.  Currently, it
%	  doesn't do anything, since these are the only specifications
%         supported.  However, I recommend including it in the options
%         list so that, if and when new specifications are introduced,
%         your old papers will not be affected.
% \end{mylist}
%
% \section{Cover Page, Title Block, and Abstract}
%
% Because, for review papers, the abstract must appear on both the cover
% page and the first page, the commands for generating the cover page, title
% block, and abstract have been combined into a single command: ^^A
% \begin{quote} |\acmopening{|\textit{abstract}|}| \end{quote}
% This should be the first text-generating command issued after
% |\begin{document}|.
% Authors should not use the |\maketitle| command or the |abstract| and
% |titlepage| environments.
%
% \subsection{Data fields}
%
% In addition to the |\title| and |\author| commands provided by the |article|
% class, several other pieces of information can be set.
% Each of these commands takes a single argument, the value to which the
% corresponding field should be set.
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item |\affiliation|
%
%       If all the authors share an affiliation, it can be set with this
%       command rather than individually within the author command.
%       The affiliation will appear centered below the author list.
%
%   \item |\acmcategory| and |\acmformat|
%
%	The paper category (research, systems, ...) and format (short,
%	long, ...).
%
%   \item |\contactname|, |\contactaddress|, |\contactphone|, |\contactfax|,
%	|\contactemail|
%
%	These should be used to set the information about the person to
%	be contacted about the paper.
%
%   \item |\acmpassport|
%
%	The author who will receive compensation if the paper is accepted.
% \end{mylist}
%
% \subsection{Cover page}
%
% When the |review| option is specified, the |\acmopening| command will
% generate a cover sheet.
% Placing the |\suppresscover| command in the preamble will prevent this.
% The cover sheet will contain:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item Title
%   \item Authors
%   \item Affiliation (if any)
%   \item Paper category and format
%   \item Contact information
%   \item Author to receive compensation
%   \item Abstract
% \end{mylist}
%
% \subsection{Title block}
%
% For a camera ready document the title block will contain:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item Title
%   \item Authors
%   \item Affiliation (if any)
% \end{mylist}
%
% If the |review| option is chosen it will instead contain:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item Title
%   \item Paper category and format
% \end{mylist}
% The |review| option will also suppress printing of any information
% specified with the |\thanks| command.
%
% \subsection{Abstract}
%
% In addition to being printed on the cover sheet (if any), the abstract
% will also appear in it's normal position at the beginning of the paper.
%
% \section{Other Features}
%
% \subsection{Copyright notice}
%
% As with the old |siggraph.sty|, this class provides a |\copyrightspace|
% command to leave space at the bottom of the first column for the copyright
% notice.
% This command should be placed after the last footnote that will appear in
% the first column.
%
% \subsection{Conditional text}
%
% The class also provides the following four commands for writing text
% conditional on whether the |cameraready| or |review| option has been
% chosen:
% \begin{quote}^^A
%	|\ifcamera{|\textit{thenclause}|}|
%
%	|\ifreview{|\textit{thenclause}|}|
%
%	|\ifcameraelse{|\textit{thenclause}|}{|\textit{elseclause}|}|
%
%	|\ifreviewelse{|\textit{thenclause}|}{|\textit{elseclause}|}|
% \end{quote}^^A
% The first two will generate the \textit{thenclause} if the |cameraready|
% (resp. |review|) option is chosen, otherwise they resolve to a null string.
% The second two are the same as the first two but generate the
% \textit{elseclause} instead of a null string if the condition is not met.
%
% These can be used for writing the paper so as to protect anonymity for
% a submission for review, without having to worry about going back over it
% months later to put the identifying information back in if the paper
% is accepted.  For example:
% \begin{quote}^^A
%   |In \cite{FooBar1994}, \ifcameraelse{we}{Foo and Bar} showed that ...|
% \end{quote}
% or
% \begin{quote}^^A
%   |as illustrated in the following \ifcameraelse{three}{two} images:|
%
%   [include generic image]
%
%   |\ifcamera{| [include our logo] |}|
%
%   [include another generic image]
% \end{quote}
%
% \subsection{Configuration file}
%
% Individual users or sites may wish to modify the behavior of this
% class (for instance, to use a particular set of fonts.)
% Rather than having people hack the |.cls| file, which can lead to
% various incompatible versions at different sites, the class provides
% for a configuration file.
% After the class has finished loading, it will check to see if a
% |siggraph.cfg| file exists in the \TeX{} search path.
% If so, it will be input.
% Any user-- or site--specific modifications should be placed in this file.
% \textit{(See the copyright notice in the |siggraph.dtx| source file for
% information on distribution of configuration files.)}

% \section{Implementation}
%
% \begin{quote}
% Warning: The implementation is a work in progress and may undergo radical
% alterations before the first non-beta release.  Do not count on any of
% the internal representations remaining the same.  Any suggestions for
% improving any aspects of the implementation are welcome.
% \end{quote}
%
% \subsection{Initial stuff}

Subject: Bibliography - HELP!
Status: R

HELP! I took over the maintenance of Eric Haines' RADBIB radiosity
bibliography earlier this year. Happily, 1994 was a *very* good
year for radiosity and global-illumination related books and
papers. To date, I've found references to 5 books and 60 papers.

My problem is that it is very difficult to track down some of the
more obscure papers, especially university technical reports and
European conference proceedings. I am therefore asking for a few
minutes of your time.

The following message (Biblio - 1994 Additions) contains the 1994
additions to the bibliography. (It's over 560 lines long, so
download it at your peril.) If you or your graduate students have
published *anything* related to global illumination this year, would
you please check to see whether I have included it. If not, then I
would very much appreciate having you send me the appropriate
reference via e-mail. (I would appreciate receiving a copy of your
paper even more!)

To save you some time, here's the list of publications I've
already referenced:

* 1994 Illuminating Engineering Society Annual Conference
* ACM SIGGRAPH '94 Proceedings
* Computer Graphics Forum
* Computers & Graphics
* Fifth Eurographics Workshop on Rendering 
* 4th Discrete Geometry for Computer Imagery
* IEEE Computer 
* International Journal of Lighting Research and Technology 
* LICHT
* Proceedings of Pacific Graphics '94 / CADDM '94 
* Proceedings of the Winter School of Computer Graphics '94 

The current release of the bibliography is available via ftp from:

  hobbes.lbl.gov as /pub/doc/RadBib94.Z
  siggraph.org in the database "biblio" through the "biblook"
    program

and through the World Wide Web at the URL:

  http://siggraph.org/library/bibliography/bibliography.hmtl

The next release will be sometime this month. Thanks for your
cooperation.

| 
| My biggest worry is about irradiance and radiant exitance.  I try
| to use IES symbols when possible because they have an ANSI document
| for terms and symbols, but I can't bring myself to use E (for one reason
| because I am using expected values in the same paper).  Should I
| use H, and then use B for radiant exitance (radiosity)?  If anyone
| has words of wisdom for me, please share them.
| 
| Have a happy holiday!

in lighting design we use the following terms:


luminance: this is actually what you see (or close to it).

	symbol:	L	
	unit:   cd/m2	(candela per square meter)
	unitUS: fL      (footlambert, a unit of luminance equal to 1/pi 
			candela per square foot)

illiminance: this is what lighting designers are working most on
	     fiktive surfaces since its independend from the reflection
	     coefficient of the material

	symbol: E
	unit:   lx	(lux)
	unitUS: fc	(footcandle, a unit of illuminance when the foot 
			is taken as a unit length)


luminous flux: the time rate of flow of light

	symbol: P	(phi)	
	unit:   lm	(lumen)



luminous intensity: the luminous flux per unit solid angle in the 
		    direction of question


	symbol: I
	unit:   cd 
	unit:   lm/sr	(lumen per steradian)



All these terms could be found in the IES Lighting Handbook 1984 Reference 
Volume.  There are much more of these terms and symbols, but this is the 
collection we use most.

Actually in our radiosity algorithm we store E on all of our surfaces.


I hope i haven't wasted yor time, and a happy new year to all of you!

SIGGRAPH class, version 0.6.3(beta), January 9, 1994
Written by Daniel Kartch
           Program of Computer Graphics
           Cornell University
           dan@graphics.cornell.edu

This distribution provides a document class for formatting papers
according to the specifications for submission to the annual
ACM Siggraph conference.  It contains three files:

README - this file
siggraph.dtx - documented source code
siggraph.ins - installation driver

To install it, type
  latex siggraph.ins
Then place the resulting siggraph.cls file somewhere where TeX can find it.

To generate the user's guide, type
  latex siggraph.dtx
  makeindex -s gglo.ist -o siggraph.gls siggraph.glo
  latex siggraph.dtx

This is a beta release and hasn't been thoroughly tested yet. Please
send me any bug reports, suggestions for improvement, or other comments.
I will do my best to fix any problems before the Siggraph submission
deadline, but I make no promises.  The likelihood of my responding to
any given comment is directly proportional to the amount of time before
the deadline that the comment is received.

This package is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
and to promote compatibility of documents created at different sites,

%
% \section{Introduction}
%
% This document describes the |siggraph| document class, for use with \LaTeXe{}.
% It is intended as a replacement for the various versions of the old
% |siggraph.sty| file that have been floating around for years.
% It loads in the |article| class and modifies several parameters
% to comply with the layout specifications for a paper submitted to
% the ACM Siggraph conference.
% Currently, these specifications are:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item $\frac{3}{4}$ inch margins on top and sides, 1 inch margin on bottom
%   \item two column mode with 2 pica column separation
%   \item space for copyright is 4.5 pica
%   \item 9 point type on 10 point baselines
%   \item titles and section headings are bold sans serif
% \changes{v0.6.1}{1994/12/26}{Made titles bold}
%   \item no page numbers (|cameraready| mode only)
% \changes{v0.6.3}{1995/01/06}{Put page numbers back in for review option}
% \end{mylist}
% Also set by the class but not part of the siggraph specifications are:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item 1 em paragraph indentation
%   \item |flushbottom| mode
% \end{mylist}
%
% The class also allows the user to specify whether the paper is being
% submitted for blind review or as a final, camera-ready document.
% Based on this specification, it will put the appropriate information
% in the title block on the first page.
% It will also automatically generate a cover sheet for papers being
% submitted for review.
% Mechanisms are also provided to allow the user to introduce conditional
% text based on this choice.
%
% \vspace{\baselineskip}
% \begin{quote}
%   This is a beta release and hasn't been thoroughly tested yet. Please
%   send me any bug reports, suggestions for improvement, or other comments.
%   I will do my best to fix any problems before the Siggraph submission
%   deadline, but I make no promises.  The likelihood of my responding to
%   any given comment is directly proportional to the amount of time before
%   the deadline that the comment is received.
% \end{quote}
%
% \section{Usage}
%
% To use this class, specify
% \begin{verbatim} \documentclass{siggraph} \end{verbatim}
% at the beginning of your document.
% Any options which can be used with the |article| class can be used here,
% with the following exceptions and caveats:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item The |landscape| and |titlepage| options are disabled.
%   \item Although |twocolumn| mode is the default, the |onecolumn| option
%         is still enabled.  However, I strongly recommend against using
%         it.  Studies of printed material have shown that, for good
%	  legibility, a line of printed material
%	  should contain no more that ten to twelve words, and at the
%	  9 point type size used by this class, that limit will be greatly
%	  exceeded in one column mode.  I didn't disable the option because
%	  it has been pointed out to me that some people prefer to use
%	  it when submitting their paper for review.  If you insist on
%	  using it, I recommend increasing the type size.
% \changes{v0.6.3}{1995/01/09}{Fixed onecolumn option}
%   \item By default, the document will use 9 point type, which is the
%	  size required by Siggraph for camera ready copies.  The |10pt|,
%	  |11pt|, and |12pt| options will override this.
% \end{mylist}
%
% In addition, the following options are provided:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item[|review| and |cameraready|] These specify whether the paper is
%         to be formatted as a submission for review or a camera-ready
%         final copy.  The default is |cameraready|.  The exact effects
%         of these options will be discussed later.
%   \item[|version1994|] The submission specifications may some day change, and
%         this class will therefore also need to be modified.  However,
%         we will still want older documents to maintain their appearance.
%	  This option says that the paper should be formatted according to
%	  the specifications that were in effect in 1994.  Currently, it
%	  doesn't do anything, since these are the only specifications
%         supported.  However, I recommend including it in the options
%         list so that, if and when new specifications are introduced,
%         your old papers will not be affected.
% \end{mylist}
%
% \section{Cover Page, Title Block, and Abstract}
%
% Because, for review papers, the abstract must appear on both the cover
% page and the first page, the commands for generating the cover page, title
% block, and abstract have been combined into a single command: ^^A
% \begin{quote} |\acmopening{|\textit{abstract}|}| \end{quote}
% This should be the first text-generating command issued after
% |\begin{document}|.
% Authors should not use the |\maketitle| command or the |abstract| and
% |titlepage| environments.
%
% \subsection{Data fields}
%
% In addition to the |\title| and |\author| commands provided by the |article|
% class, several other pieces of information can be set.
% Each of these commands takes a single argument, the value to which the
% corresponding field should be set.
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item |\affiliation|
%
%       If all the authors share an affiliation, it can be set with this
%       command rather than individually within the author command.
%       The affiliation will appear centered below the author list.
%
%   \item |\acmcategory| and |\acmformat|
%
%	The paper category (research, systems, ...) and format (short,
%	long, ...).
%
%   \item |\contactname|, |\contactaddress|, |\contactphone|, |\contactfax|,
%	|\contactemail|
%
%	These should be used to set the information about the person to
%	be contacted about the paper.
%
%   \item |\acmpassport|
%
%	The author who will receive compensation if the paper is accepted.
% \end{mylist}
%
% \subsection{Cover page}
%
% When the |review| option is specified, the |\acmopening| command will
% generate a cover sheet.
% Placing the |\suppresscover| command in the preamble will prevent this.
% The cover sheet will contain:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item Title
%   \item Authors
%   \item Affiliation (if any)
%   \item Paper category and format
%   \item Contact information
%   \item Author to receive compensation
%   \item Abstract
% \end{mylist}
%
% \subsection{Title block}
%
% For a camera ready document the title block will contain:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item Title
%   \item Authors
%   \item Affiliation (if any)
% \changes{v0.6.2}{1995/01/05}{Fixed missing affiliation in title block}
% \end{mylist}
%
% If the |review| option is chosen it will instead contain:
% \begin{mylist}
%   \item Title
%   \item Paper category and format
% \end{mylist}
% The |review| option will also suppress printing of any information
% specified with the |\thanks| command.
%
% \subsection{Abstract}
%
% In addition to being printed on the cover sheet (if any), the abstract
% will also appear in it's normal position at the beginning of the paper.
%
% \section{Other Features}
%
% \subsection{Copyright notice}
%
% As with the old |siggraph.sty|, this class provides a |\copyrightspace|
% command to leave space at the bottom of the first column for the copyright
% notice.
% This command should be placed after the last footnote that will appear in
% the first column.
%
% \subsection{Conditional text}
%
% The class also provides the following four commands for writing text
% conditional on whether the |cameraready| or |review| option has been
% chosen:
% \begin{quote}^^A
%	|\ifcamera{|\textit{thenclause}|}|
%
%	|\ifreview{|\textit{thenclause}|}|
%
%	|\ifcameraelse{|\textit{thenclause}|}{|\textit{elseclause}|}|
%
%	|\ifreviewelse{|\textit{thenclause}|}{|\textit{elseclause}|}|
% \end{quote}^^A
% The first two will generate the \textit{thenclause} if the |cameraready|
% (resp. |review|) option is chosen, otherwise they resolve to a null string.
% The second two are the same as the first two but generate the
% \textit{elseclause} instead of a null string if the condition is not met.
%
% These can be used for writing the paper so as to protect anonymity for
% a submission for review, without having to worry about going back over it
% months later to put the identifying information back in if the paper
% is accepted.  For example:
% \begin{quote}^^A
%   |In \cite{FooBar1994}, \ifcameraelse{we}{Foo and Bar} showed that ...|
% \end{quote}
% or
% \begin{quote}^^A
%   |as illustrated in the following \ifcameraelse{three}{two} images:|
%
%   [include generic image]
%
%   |\ifcamera{| [include our logo] |}|
%
%   [include another generic image]
% \end{quote}
%
% \subsection{Configuration file}
%
% Individual users or sites may wish to modify the behavior of this
% class (for instance, to use a particular set of fonts.)
% Rather than having people hack the |.cls| file, which can lead to
% various incompatible versions at different sites, the class provides
% for a configuration file.
% After the class has finished loading, it will check to see if a
% |siggraph.cfg| file exists in the \TeX{} search path.
% If so, it will be input.
% Any user-- or site--specific modifications should be placed in this file.
% \textit{(See the copyright notice in the |siggraph.dtx| source file for
% information on distribution of configuration files.)}

%
% \section{Implementation}
%
% \begin{quote}
% Warning: The implementation is a work in progress and may undergo radical
% alterations before the first non-beta release.  Do not count on any of
% the internal representations remaining the same.  Any suggestions for
% improving any aspects of the implementation are welcome.
% \end{quote}
%
% \subsection{Initial stuff}
%
% First off, we need to load in the |ifthen| package and declare the boolean
% variable |acm@cameraready|, since we use this in the option handling. 
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{ifthen}
\newboolean{acm@cameraready}
\newboolean{acm@useninepoint}
\setboolean{acm@useninepoint}{true}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% \subsection{Option processing}
%
% Disable the |titlepage| and |landscape| options.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareOption{titlepage}{%
  \OptionNotUsed%
  \ClassWarningNoLine{siggraph}{titlepage option not allowed}}
\DeclareOption{landscape}{%
  \OptionNotUsed%
  \ClassWarningNoLine{siggraph}{landscape option not allowed}}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% Allow |onecolumn|, |10pt|, |11pt|, and |12pt| options, but produce
% warnings.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand{\acm@columnmode}{twocolumn}
\DeclareOption{onecolumn}{%
  \ClassWarningNoLine{siggraph}{One-column mode selected.\MessageBreak%
        Switching to two-column mode is recommended.}%
  \renewcommand{\acm@columnmode}{onecolumn}}
\DeclareOption{10pt}{%
  \ClassWarningNoLine{siggraph}{10 point type selected.\MessageBreak%
        Siggraph camera-ready specifications require 9 point.}%
  \PassOptionsToClass{10pt}{article}%

Hi,

some days ago Ian Asdown posted a pointer to some color quanti techniques.
Concerning 24->8 bit quantization one has to take care of the following:
Usually quantization techniques are linear ones; however our audio-visual
system uses a nonlinear scale (see Weber-Fechner-law in acoustics).
Hence the visual image quality of 8bit images can be improved by a simple
procedure
1st - nonlinear color scaling
2nd - color quantization
3rd - invers scaling to 1st
4th - rendering

Some work concerning these problems was done in 1993 as MS at CS dep.
of university of Rostock.
A: Joern Trilk
T: Nichtlineare Farbskalierung fuer die realistische Bilddarstellung
K: you see, in German

This work includes visual comparison of different scaling functions like
log Weber-Fechner, Cornsweet, Paeth, ... and the corresponding C-code.
In addition to that you can find a good reference list (mostly in 
English). Maybe this is for some use to you.

Hi --

We have also been looking at the image comparison problem. I don't
have any good suggestions right now, but our approach is to
try to build on the work on image metrics for evaluating the
effects of lossy compression. Here are some references. I'm not
familiar with these papers in any depth, so you have to make
your own assessments of their usefulness:

Mannos & Sakrison, "The Effects of a Vision Fidelity Criterion
on the Encoding of Images", IEEE Trans. on Information Theory,
vol. it-20, July 1974, pp. 525-536.

Saghri, Cheatham, & Habbi "Image quality measure based on a human
visual system model", Optical Engineering, July 1989, vol 28, no. 7,
pp. 813-818.


Nill, " A Visual Model Weighted Cosine Transform for Image Compression
and Quality Assessment", IEEE Transactions on Communications,
vol. com-33, no. 6, June 1985, pp. 551-557

Even if you can't find these particular papers, you can probably
draw some inspiration for methods to test out by rifling through
the literature on evaluating lossy compression methods. I think
incorporating even simple-minded human visual models would give
useful results, and keep the metric from going beserk in dark
areas, etc.

Hi All,

For some time I have been using a brute force Path Tracing method
to validate the results from other global illumination methods.
The results are images in which the pixel values are represented
as either pure float (one per. wavelength) or as Greg Wards real
pixels.

My question is: How can I compare these images?

I have primarily been using a squared sum of pixel differences. This
means that the two images being compared are subtracted giving
a difference image. The pixel values in the difference image are
squared and added together giving some number (=error) indicating the 
"distance" between the two images. This method is relatively good but 
it gives pour ratings to images which have just a few pixels with a large 
distance (these images could perhaps be corrected using a noise reduction 
filter). Furthermore the method doesn't say much about the visual quality 
of the image being validated -- sometimes a little noise does look good...
The error (number) also depends on the brightness of the image and images 
which has problems in dark areas (like shadows) gets a smaller error than
images with problems in bright areas. It has no meaning (or very little 
meaning) comparing the error resulting from the computation of different 
images. etc....

Alternative methods could be: Maximum pixel difference, Average pixel 
difference etc.

I would like some kind of normalized squared sum of pixel differences. 
It should, however, not "go berserk" in very dark areas with relatively 
large (but still invisible errors). And even better if the method
gave the error 42 using the same global illumination method on two
different images then the "looks of the error" would be the same
on the two images (is this impossible?).


That was my first two cents :-)

Subject: image quality metrics
Status: R

I've played with Mannos and Sakrison's method.  The wisdom at Bell Labs 
seemed to be that numerical image-quality metrics were a sort of holy 
grail that has never been completely achieved.  Be careful.  There is 
so much going on in our subjective response!  Methods like M&S can take 
into account the logarithmic response to contrast and the basic color 
and spatial frequency dependance.  Oh wait, the color response stuff is 
in another paper by Werner Frei (I'll try to find that reference).  But 
there are other things like visual masking that are hard to model -- 
the visibility of noise depends a lot on the context.

Don't be afraid to do subjective testing.  Well, be a little afraid, 
because its a pain in the neck to organize it, but I think letting 
expert observers make judgements means more than assigning a mysterious 
number (which ultimate is based on some fit to some set of 
subjective-testing data anyway!).

I would agree completely.  I did a lot of work on the perceptual
brightness of light sources for my thesis, and perceptual testing
seems to be the only reliable (well, pretty reliable anyhow) way to
test image quality.  It is a pain to design a good test, though.  The
up side is that you don't usually need too many subjects.

More image comparison/quality thoughts...

The textbook "Flat-Panel Displays and CRTs" has an excellent
chapter entitled "Image Quality: Measures and Visual Performance"
by Harry Snyder.  He characterizes a number of pixel error
measures of image quality ( primarily based on mean square error,
some weighted by properties of the human visual system ).  The
real strength of the chapter though is it's coverage of techniques
that use the Modulation Transfer Function of display systems to
obtain spatial information that can be compared with characteristics
of our visual capabilities.

I agree with Holly there is a lot of info in the compression
literature on this topic.  I recommend also scanning the
the displays literature and television journals specifically,
the Society for Information Display and the Society for Motion
Picture and Television Engineers ( SID and SMPTE ) both hold
a high stake in developing metrics for measuring image quality.

Here are a few more references:

Perception and Scene Properties. SMPTE Journal May 1993: p.392-397

Characteristics of the Human Visual System.  IEEE Transactions

Statistical comparison of image data is useful but to obtain measures
of image quality perceptual models will have to be incorporated.  As
mentioned subjective ratings may be an alternative presently but
herein lies some pitfalls as well.  Experimental design must be
controlled to assure subjects are rating actual quality as opposed
to simply preference.  ( there's no accounting for taste )  I have
used a pair-wise comparison where subjects are presented both a
reference image and a test image and are then asked to rank their
impression of the test against the reference this works out well.

Subject: More image comparison thoughts
Status: RO


I think that a single universal image "error" metric doesn't exist,
simply because one type of image deviation may be trivial for one
application but horrible for another. The diversity of uses for an
error metric make a universal measure impossible.

Consider two images which are identical except one image has been
shifted over one pixel to the right. If these images were a before and
after version of a test of a compression method, you'd want to use a
human perception metric of difference. Put the images side by side and
any viewer would probably say "Fantastic!". But if the images were
comparisons of one radiosity method with a "truth" image from extreme
oversampled Monte Carlo, you'd probably look for mean squared and
maximum pixel differences of some sort. Here the offset registration
causes very large errors in the two images, especially at sharp
horizontal intensity changes.

So error metrics should be tailored to the application. I would feel
that a new global illumination method would best be measured against a
"known" image by simple mean squared pixel intensity differences,
probably independently at each wavelength. These differneces should be
in actual intensity differences if possible, not cruddy quantized
0-255 RGB values. This is a more physical, direct measurement, showing
any differences at a very low level. When testing a new algorithmic
method for light transport, these importances are probably the most
important.

A visual metric might be better for determining speedups for a
specific renderer. Say I'm trying to add Greg Ward's cool method of
estimating shadow coverages of hundreds of light sources to a current
commerical renderer. The users of the renderer are logo pilots and
general animators. If the image doesn't LOOK different, and rendering
is much faster, I'm likely to have happy customers. Even if the
accuracy of rendering has decreased considerably (maybe the shadow
boundaries are a lot noisier, with changes of +- 10% in the correct
RGB values) it doesn't matter as long as peopele viewing the image
don't notice or at least notice much.

Unlike pixel by pixel mean-squared differences, trying to come up with
a metric for human vision is a lot trickier. One group that probably
put the most work into this topic were the nameless engineers who
crafted NTSC in the 50's. They had an insanely small bandwidth to pack
as much image quality as they could into. They exploited our vision's
weak points by allocating their bandwidth carefully. I would think
that a better VISUAL metric would come from pixel by pixel differences
in YUV space rather than RGB space, and weighting Y errors much more
than U and U more than V, as NTSC does. This doesn't solve some
problems, though: think about the case where you increase each pixel's
intensity 5% uniformly. Visually the image doesn't change much, but
the pixel by pixel differences all have a 5% absolute error in
them. Oops.  Maybe some global gamma/contrast/brightness tweaking
should attempt to "match" the two images first, THEN use pixel by
pixel differences. But what about nonlinear spacial intensity changes,
like the ones Rushmier, Ward, and Shirley have played with?
Arggh.. there's an awful lot to account for!

So forming a quantitative VISUAL difference metric is, simply, a
pain. I will buy dinner for anyone who can come up with a good model
or two and actually compare these to human experimentation where
people rate image "differences" by eye.

But luckily, the more sterile question of validating an algorithm can
use less subjective measures. Simple pixel by pixel mean, mean
squared, and maximum errors, are enough to quickly tell wether the two
algorithms agree or disagree. Especially in radiation transport, we do
know how to use the right units for measurements of light flux though
a solid angle, and that's all we're trying to compute accurately.

Anyway, just some thoughts to keep this thread going. I'm glad I
discovered this list...

Hi everyone,

Thanks for all the replies and an interesting discussion...

I can see that it is difficult to compute just one number/error
related to the 'perceptual difference' between two images. 

Subjective testing avoids this difficulty, but I agree with
Holly that subjective testing cannot replace an error metric. 
Firstly, subjective testing is, well, subjective. I am used to 
looking at and seeing errors in a computer generated image therefore 
I will probably catch more errors than a person who is not working
with computer graphics. I also find it quite unsatisfactory to write
in a paper: ".. as we can see it looks good..". Furthermore I like
to examine the effects of different parameters in my software by
plotting a graph showing the convergence/error (currently the RMS-error) 
as a function of one of these parameters -- this is not possible
with subjective testing.

When comparing two images A and B we could extract a number of
features from the difference image C=A-B. For instance we could
examine whether C contains edges that aren't in the reference image A.
We could also test whether C is noisy in areas where A is smooth etc.
These features could be weighted and added together to give an error
metric. I guess someone has tried this before...

A good error metric could initially be used to speed up current
global illumination algorithms. Perhaps improve methods featuring
progressive refinement. Later on we might be able to incorporate
the error metric in our algorithms in order to automatically determine
when we are finished. Currently the most common stop-criteria within
Monte Carlo ray tracing is the variance - which is directly related to 
the RMS-error. This criteria is unfortunate since we often use more
samples than necessary. An example is procedural textures based on
Perlins noise function. Since noise is a property of the texture and
therefore not disturbing the use of variance as a stop-criteria results
in unnecessary oversampling of these textures. If we had an error metric
capable of saying whether the noise is disturbing or not then we could
do a lot better...

Subject: error metrics, color
Status: R

Naturally, you want to have some number to minimize when you are trying 
various image synthesis methods.  RMS error is an obvious one.  But I 
caution against equating that number with "image quality".  Variance 
and RMS error are actually quite poor measure of subjective image 
quality -- logarithmic weight or cube-root weight would even be a 
better measure of visible error than summing the square of the error.  
The spatial frequency effects the visibility of noise, with the maximum 
response being around 12 cycles per degree.

The dependance on color is especially tricky.  A common mistake in 
color quantization is to us Luv or Lab coordinates -- if you look at 
the SMTPE literature, you'll find they recommend almost the opposite 
metric, with a strong emphasis on reducing noise in the green channel.  
This is because there are really two kinds of error being talked about: 
color-matching error, and visibility of spatial patterns of noise.  Luv 
is about color matching, the eye is quite insensitive to variations in 
shades of green, for example.  But if you are worried about grain noise 
or dither patterns, the eye is most sensitive to green colored patterns.

Getting back to metrics.  Simple measures like variance or log-error 
might be fine for measuring the error in a pixel.  But you certainly 
need more complex metrics if you are looking at global noise 
characteristics.  RMS error was not at all useful in the work I 
reported in my SIGGRAPH 91 paper on spectrally optimal sampling, but I 
think the images clearly demonstrated the value of forcing noise into 
high frequencies.  I used the Mannos  Sakrison metric at that time and 
found the results to be poorly correlated with subjective image 
quality.  For me, seeing is believing, and I did not use the M&S numbers.

Subject: A perceptual image metric (monochrome)
Status: RO

P. Teo & D. Heeger at Stanford have a promising  perceptual image metric.
They try to model the response of  directionally- selective cells in
the striate cortex using modified image pyramids and steerable filters,
so that noise patterns that are aligned with nearby image features 
contribute much  less error than misaligned noise.  It is rather elaborate,
but built on solid results from psychophysics and physiology.  Their example
pictures are impressive. See:

"Perceptual Image Distortion", Teo, Patrick C., and Heeger, David J.,
pp.982-986 Proceedings of First International Conference on Image
Processing, Austin TX,  Nov. 1994.

It's  monochrome, though, and assumes moderate, CRT-like luminances-- 
not intended for high-dynamic range images.

Dear all,

this is not really a globillum question, but I am sure
many of you probably can help me with this request.

I am trying to locate a 3D dataset of a human head. I am 
in fact only interested in the skull at the moment, but I figured
I could extract it easily from any of the medical datasets that
have been floating around.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to do so with the head dataset
from the UNC ftp site. More precisely I haven't been able
to extract the skull from the data with simple classification tools.
Maybe I am doing something wrong, or maybe the MRI data is not well
suited to the particular classification I need ? can somebody confirm
or deny this?

Anyway, my questions are

	o	would somebody have a pre-classified volume dataset of a skull?
	o	would somebody have a volume dataset of a head that seems easy
		enough to classify so that the skull can be separated?
		maybe CT data would be better than MRI?

Thanks in advance

I think that's exactly correct: CT is best at distinguishing bone, and
MRI was developed to look at soft tissue.

I have an old friend who used to be involved with nuclear medicine
sorts of things, and I'll ask him if he has any skulls lying around.

it's simple to set up and non-intrusive.  Send "help" to the address at the
bottom of the message if you're interested (there's also a Usenet news
searcher that Stanford runs which scans netnews for articles with your keyword
and sends you the first 20 lines of each article - handy if you don't have

 TITLE:: Wavelet Methods for Computer Graphics (Thesis)
 AUTHOR:: Gortler, Steven J.
 DATE:: January 1995
 PAGES:: 183
 ABSTRACT::
 This thesis discusses how a wavelet basis can be used in the context of
 two computer graphics applications, realistic rendering and geometric
 modeling, to produced more efficient and flexible algorithms.
 
 The goal of realistic rendering is to simulate the interreflection of
 light in some geometric environment in order to produce realistic
 images. Radiosity is a commonly used solution method for this problem.
 Recently Hanrahan et al. have introduced a hierarchical method that can solve
 radiosity problems in $O(n)$ time instead of $O(n^2)$.  This thesis
 explores how the hierarchical radiosity algorithm can be formally understood
 from the context of wavelet theory.  When the radiosity problem is
 expressed with respect to a wavelet basis, the resulting linear system
 is sparse, with only $O(n)$ significant terms.  By casting the hierarchical
 method in this framework, a variety of wavelet basis functions can be
 used, resulting in more efficient radiosity methods.
 
 This thesis also discusses how wavelets can be used in the context of
 geometric modeling.  Geometric modeling is the study of how geometric
 shapes can be represented and manipulated by a designer.  This thesis
 explores the use of wavelets to represent parametric curves and
 surfaces within the context of geometric modeling interfaces.
 
 One intuitive modeling interface commonly used in geometric modeling
 allows the user to directly manipulate curves and surfaces. This
 manipulation defines some set of constraints that the curve or surface
 must satisfy (such as interpolation and tangent constraints).  Direct
 manipulation, however, usually leads to an underconstrained problem
 since there are, in general, many possible surfaces meeting some set
 of constraints.  Therefore an optimization problem must be solved.
 
 This thesis discusses how geometric modeling optimization problems can
 be solved more efficiently by using a wavelet basis.  Because the
 wavelet basis is hierarchical, iterative optimization methods converge
 rapidly.  And because the wavelet coefficients indicate the degree of
 detail in the solution, they can be used to determine the number of
 basis functions needed to express the variational minimum, thus
 avoiding unnecessary computation.  An implementation is discussed and
 experimental results are reported.

 TITLE:: An Adaptive Gauss Method for Computing Irradiance Coefficients of Galerkin Radiosity System s
 AUTHOR:: Gershbein, Reid
 DATE:: February 1995
 PAGES:: 10
 ABSTRACT::
 Computing energy transfer between objects is the most expensive
 operation in radiosity systems.  This energy transfer operation, known
 as the irradiance operator, is an integral that, in general, must be
 calculated numerically.  We wish to increase the speed of this
 computation without severely compromising fidelity and perform a study
 of numerical integration techniques, $Quadrature$ $Methods$.  The
 results of our study show the strengths of $Gauss$ $Quadrature$
 $Rules$ and give us insights into greatly reducing the cost of the
 irradiance operator while maintaining accuracy.  An adaptive method
 for choosing Gauss quadrature rules is presented, and our performance
 analysis of the new adaptive algorithm shows that it can be up to 10
 times faster than previous methods.

Coalescing vertices from disjoint polygons is not particularly difficult,
so long as your scenes are reasonably well-behaved.  I wrote a translator
from Radiance format (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/HOME.html) to MGF
(http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html) which coalesced vertices using a
simple hashing scheme.  You are welcome to the source code for this --
it is on the above-mentioned servers.

As far as connectivity information goes, I know nothing.  It's a meshy problem!

Dani Lischinski and Fillipo Tampieri used BSP trees to track
discontinuities through space. BSP trees are fairly compact geometry
representations that do not require explicit connectivity information, and
so might be good for you. They would not be very useful for extracting
polyhedra, however. I don't have the references right in front of me, so I
hesitate to specify them; but I have them on my desk at work if needed.

If you are not familiar with BSP trees, you might want to look at the BSP
tree FAQ, which is still under construction:

Dear GlobIllumers,

A few years ago a comparison between Radiance and a radiosity implementation
on a moderately complex scene lead to the conclusion that Radiance was
faster.

I have wondered whether it in general is safe to assume that Monte Carlo 
based ray tracing methods are faster in highly complex scenes (ie. scenes 
with billions of objects) considering newer radiosity techniques like 
hierarchical radiosity and radiosity using clustering?

I know it depends on the contents of the scene, but if we omit the irradiance
gradient method and use path tracing or bidirectional path tracing and
continue to increase the number of objects in the scene then I think
we would see that the Monte Carlo techniques would render the scene
in constant time, while radiosity somehow depends on the number of objects.

Bretton,

with all due respect I must ask you to be more careful about
dispensing incorrect and/or misleading information in your
replies, in your BSP faq, and elsewhere.

A.) BSP trees are arguably not "compact," as they require
Omega(n^2) storage and O(n^3) construction time for some
3D inputs.  The storage lower bound is tight, see p. 500 of

@article{Paterson90,
    author = "Michael S. Paterson and F. Frances Yao",
    title = "Efficient Binary Space Partitions for
		Hidden-Surface Removal and Solid Modeling",
    journal = "Discrete and Computational Geometry",
    volume = 5,
    number = 5,
    year = 1990,
    pages = "485--503",
    comments = "also Xerox PARC tech report CSL 89-6"}

Stated differently, this means that there inputs of n
polygons in 3d for which *every* BSP tree has size
at least O(n^2).

Apparently you have not yet corrected your FAQ

	http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/bsp?18.txt

in this regard.  Your statement there that BSP's have a

	"provable lower bound [of] O(n)"

doesn't make any sense.

B) A BSP tree, if available, would be an ideal preprocessed data
structure from which to abstract a winged-edge, facet-edge, or
other adjacency data structure.  You don't need a reference to
see how; you simply walk the (necessarily convex) leaves of the
tree, inducing shared edge pointers wherever two cutting planes
of the BSP tree meet two faces of the input polyhedron along
a common line in 3-space.

Regards,

Seth.

Status: R

I don't think Seth was being rude.  It's important to understand the 
computational complexity of the algorithms we use, and visibility is a 
very tricky game in this regard.  BSP-trees seem to gather a lot of 
passionate evangelism and detraction.  I believe Apollo built a CAD 
system with BSP trees which did go O(n^2) -- pretty much in their 
customers' faces.  I've heard other people say they never saw more than 
O(n) growth.  Ziv Gigus has a masters thesis that gives details of 
experiments and results, and there clearly needs to be more of that in 
the literature.  I seem to recall Ziv reported typical O(N logN) growth 
in 3D.  Ziv, want to comment?

What is really needed is an ongoing contest between inputs and 
algorithms.  Something like this happens in the ray-tracing community, 
with Eric Haines input test scenes.  The visibility problem (not just 
BSP approaches) would benefit from this.

Revolutionary new approaches to visibility are being taken in games and 
PC graphics libraries.  I can't divulge proprietary algorithms, so I'll 
just taunt you a bit.  Look forward to some interesting revelations on 
visiblity in the coming years.  :-)

John Carmack, at id Software, deserves some special credit for the 
visibility algorithm used in DOOM.  The bspfaq says he is using bps 
trees, but I believe he has made some novel advances beyond the 
standard usage.  His first insight was that typical building interiors 
can be treated as a 2D problem instead of 3D.  Paterson and Yao point 
out that the worst-case space complexity of BSP trees is only O(N logN) 
in 2D.  Secondly, Carmack deals with occlusion culling in two 
interesting ways -- by drawing front to back with an efficient 
algorithm for knowing when the screen is completely drawn, and by 
augmenting the BSP-tree with bounding boxes for rapid culling of 
occluded subtrees.

We've been using the term "DOOM trees" to refer to Carmack's work.  I 
think he deserves that honor.  :-)

Oops. I meant a constant number of rays in the Monte Carlo techniques. The
intersection time will of course increase since none of ts optimizing
schemes for ray tracing are O(1). But still I think the increase in
intersection time is relatively small compared to the increased number
of energy transfers that should be done in the radiosity algorithm.

I will give a small example...

Consider a small house with a lawn. Doubling the amount of grass in the lawn
does not significantly change the indirect illumination on the house from
the lawn. Since the noise in Monte Carlo methods primarilly is caused by
indirect illumination this means that the noise-level would not change
significantly. Therefore rendering the house using a Monte Carlo method
could be done using the same number of rays --- this might be a large
number of rays but still....

The radiosity algorithm on the other hand would have to consider the exchange
of radiosity between every grass leave and doubling the amount of grass
would significantly increase the number of necessary radiosity transfers.

Please correct me if I am wrong....

I could reformulate this into a philosophical question.

Is path tracing the ultimate rendering method when we consider very
complex scenes? And maybe even if we only take the geometry into
consideration?

"In deserto clamavi" (Latin from memory, pardon the potential barbarisms).
Loosely translated, it means "I get no respect".

I have long claimed that a good solution for global illumination of complex
scenes is to use a "light driven" approach, namely where the light is 
transported explicitly between cells (sections of the environment), and
not between surfaces (as in "radiosity" or path following schemes).
The obvious advantage is that you control the process exactly where it
should be controlled, as a function of the amount of light transported,
not as the level of where it comes from or where it's going (even though you
still have some control about that). The other big one is that "clustering",
or simplification of the light flux, becomes a simple issue. I claim (somewhat
facetiously, but with a basis in truth) that it is the only approach that
has asymptotically the complexity of the "Utah approximation" (as Jim Kajiya
calls it) with depth-buffer visibility, namely O(N), where N is the number
of primitives in the scene. I won't go on about this, but details can be
obtained on request.

For many reasons (some fair, some not), the community has been unwilling
to accept presentation of work in this direction, even in forums (fora)
dedicated to works in progress. I think it's our collective loss, since
even if one does not believe in a particular approach, one should realize
that some of the concepts and techniques used can be relevant to other
problems (not necessarily actively considered at the time).

battle, but we had fun trying to win".

I think Alain is onto something -- and maybe it has been used after all.
As near as I can figure, the Integra system (sold by Arris in the US)
uses a cell-transfer or at least cell-collected transport mechanism similar
to the one described.  Is Karol out there listening?  Care to comment?

As to the complexity of radiosity and path tracing approaches, I think in
the end everything will be the same.  After all, they are solving the same
problem.  Recent assertions as to the storage and computation required for
advanced hierarchical and clustering radiosity methods are similar to those
one would compute for a Monte Carlo solution to the same problem.  The key
difference currently is the problem definition itself -- most radiosity
algorithms solve for the irradiance on objects, whereas most Monte Carlo
algorithms solve for the pixels in an image.  Given this difference,
radiosity is bound to win when the number of pixels grows relative to the
number of objects, and Monte Carlo will win as the number of objects grows
relative to the number of pixels.

I cite the additional evidence that most radiosity optimizations these
days focus on geometric simplification (i.e. clustering and hierarchy)
where current Monte Carlo optimizations focus on improved image sampling
and filtering.  A system such as the one Dr. Fournier proposes would no
doubt concentrate on optimal subdivision and sampling of volumes instead.

Looking at how Nature solves this problem, I would have to bet on pure
Monte Carlo for the ultimate solution.  However, given the finite resources
of the computing world, we have to go with whatever bag of tricks gets
us closest to what we want in the least amount of time.  This, it seems,
depends a good deal on the particular problem at hand.  Monte Carlo for
a forest, radiosity for three boxes.

there is still that pesky little problem of visibility. In fact we may have

Yo Alain!

If we can have adaptive gridding of the environment, then I'm with you.
Of course adaptive gridding is hard in its own right.  (There are folks
here at Ames working on exactly that kind of problem!)  And it handles
the participating media issues properly as well.  I'm really surprised to
hear you are having trouble finding a venue for this stuff.
I'm interested in hearing about some of this "work-in-progress".

Kajiya addressed this topic many years ago in a course note that 
I really liked:

Article{kaji88,
        Author  = "James T. Kajiya",
        Title   = {An Overview and Comparison of Rendering Methods},
        Journal = {A Consumer's and Developer's Guide to Image Synthesis},
        Year    = 1988,
        Pages = {259-263},
        Note = {ACM Siggraph '88 Course 12 Notes} }

He basically said that path tracing is faster than z-buffer approaches
once there are thousands of primitives per pixel (note-- he said
z-buffer-- we aren't even talking radiosity here).  I think this
assumes a static environment where you plan to make many frames in an
animation-- this way you don't have to count the O(N) (I assume a
uniform grid) setup time for ray tracing.

I think AF's method sounds pretty neat.  Please don't only share with SU!

One thing I wonder about is how to ray trace procedural environments
that are too big to be stored.  Here I think you must use something
other than straight radiosity (the light transport might have less
detail than the geometry, so the AF volume idea might still work).  Can
we encode a spatial subdivision structure in the procedural model so
that rays are log(N), where N is the number of "fully expanded"
primitive polygons (or whatever the atomic primitive is)?  How
expressive are the set of primitve objects that can have such friendly
properties?

As an analogy, Perlin-style solid textures are friendly, while
reaction-diffusion textures are not.

I think making friendly procedural objects that coexist peacefully with
hand-modeled objects is a neat (and hard) area to look at.  A start can
be found in:

Article{ambu86,
        Author  = "Phil Amburn and Eric Grant and Turner Whitted",
        Title   = {Managing Geometric Complexity 
                      with Enhanced Procedural Models},

        Number  = 4,
        Month = {August},
        Note = {ACM Siggraph '86 Conference Proceedings} }

Does anyone have a bibliography on procedural modeling?

Yes, approximate visibility is perhaps the most important and difficult 
problem now (both for Monte Carlo or finite element methods)!

We tried for a while to do some work on this, but got stuck on what we
call the "coherence problem":  

If you divide the environment into cells, approximate visibility 
information can be computed for each cell.  This can be done to 
a wide range of spatial and directional accuracy.  So far so good.
But -- when this approximate occlusion information is to be combined
from the different cells that are between the "sender" and "receiver",
the "coherence problem" arises:  Using the approximate occlusion
information, we no longer have information whether the patches in 
each cell are coherent or incoherent with the patches in the other 
cells.  

For example, if a beam of light is passing through two cells, with 
each cell having 50% occlusion within that beam (and in that direction),
the total occlusion could be anything from 50% (if all the patches in
one cluster are aligned with the patches in the other cluster) to 100%
(if the patches in one cluster overlap the "holes" through the other
cluster).

In the end, we had to go back to the "good old" technique of shooting
some number of sample rays and check each ray for intersection along
the path.  The accuracy can be controlled by the number of rays shot.
Even with a hierarchy of cells, this sampling method is very time 
consuming -- it is easily the most time consuming part of global 
illumination.  

There is plenty of room for improvement here!

One problem of using volume cells instead of surface patches is that
a non-planar assemblage of Lambertian diffusers is in general not a Lambertian
diffuser; that is, the amount of light scattered towards a given direction
may depend strongly on the incoming direction.  

In fact, the scattering function can be much more complicated than
typical models for non-Lambertian but flat surfaces.  For instance,
consider a cylindrical tin can, open at one end, painted black on the
outside and white on the inside.  Depending on where the incident
light is coming from, the percentage scattered may vary from 0 to 100%
of the incident light; and the outgoing distribution will probably
have several peaks, in funny directions.

So, I would think that a global illumination model that handles
clustering must be a "second-order" model, where the unknowns are
flows between pairs of cells, and the coefficient matrix has three-way
form factors --- "how much of the light flowing from cell i to cell j
is diverted to cell k".  Are we ready to tackle this? 

I believe Leo Guibas and Eric Veach (Stanford) were looking into this
approach a couple of years ago.  Perhaps you should get in touch with
them?

i don't know what "needs to be restated" means.

nor am i sure from where bruce took the phrase "extract a
polyhedr[on] from bsp trees".  my globillum post stated:

  A BSP tree, if available, would be an ideal preprocessed data
  structure from which to [ex]tract a winged-edge, facet-edge,
  or other adjacency data structure.

my point was that generating robust connectivity information
from an unorganized set of polygons seems hard, starting from
scratch; but if someone hands you a BSP tree for the input,
it becomes straightforward.

this statement may be true, but it is unsupported by the
scant body of empirical evidence in the literature, and
seems to be refuted by many anecdotal reports.

this is not the way to draw worthwhile conclusions about anything.

i add my voice to don mitchell's:  a thorough, objective empirical
examination of the average case (not worst case) behavior of BSP trees
is needed:  a joint effort, perhaps using bruce's public-domain code
as an agreeable "standard" testbed. i propose that we tabulate:

	construction time;
	total BSP complexity;

and perhaps

	minimum achievable BSP complexity,
		without regard to construction time

as a function of:

	varying model type (desk, plane, building, person, etc.), and
	increasing complexity (or level of detail) within each type.

who will join in this effort?

This is a great idea.  Eric Haines started such a database for ray tracing
that certainly made comparisons MUCH easier, and I think it is time to pick
some models that are more representative of real scenes.  Seth, could
we use some or all of the Berkeley CS building?  

Classifying scene properties will be fun-- I like Seth's classifications
from the 94 Siggraph paper, but a more extensive categorization is needed.

I think BSP trees and ray tracing algorithms would both be good to test on
such a database...

It is gratifying to have so many thoughtful answers to my global rumination.
It shows, though, the power of a paradigm (I must use this word because it's
convenient in the context, and "model" is overloaded in computer graphics),
in this case the rendering-equation/radiosity/form-factor/diffuse-reflector
one. The following is not to say that the relevant posts are wrong (I have 
respect for most of the posters), but that some interpolations or extrapolations
were too influenced by what is (and not helped by my tersity).

When we talk about clustering, it should be clear that what we really want
to achieve is cluster the light (the illumination), not the objects. In
other words we are not (usually) interested in the cause but in the result.
This is basic. If I am given a complete description of the light falling on
an area (or a volume, generally speaking on a subset of the universe),
I do not really care about where it comes from. Of course if my paradigm is
to consider exchange of light energy between objects, it is difficult to
deal with that, and form factors, or equivalent concepts, are hard to avoid.
Essentially I have no model to express the light outside of objects, which is
quite paradoxical when you think about it, since "free flight" light is a lot
easier to deal with than light at interfaces with matter.

Light clustering is handled easily in the light-driven approach, since
you have an explicit representation of it. Spatial hierarchy is also handled
because a reasonable implementation of the paradigm is to subdivide the scene
hierarchically and adaptively as a function of the light transported. We use
an octree, as the easiest structure to deal with, and because it fits
beautifully with the dyadic subdivisions of our wavelet-based representation of
the light flux.

There seems to be a "miracle" happening, because we seem to solve an integral
equation (the rendering equation) by non-standard ways. But it should be
realised that the rendering equation has to be solved in its standard form
only if we want to know for each surface element (or volume element) not
only its radiance, but in some way where it is getting it from, which is gross
overkill. To make the point more clearly, assume that I install a wall in the
middle of my environment which collects every photon it receives and reemits
it instantly or a some later date with the same wavelength and the same
direction on the other side. Each half space is now totally independent
by considering the wall to be an emitter with a fairly complex distribution,
and a total absorber for incident light. Of course if there are only few objects
on both sides of the wall, it is much worse than to compute directly the light
exchanged between objects, but if there are huge numbers of objects with complex
emitting and reflecting behaviour, it will always reach a point where the
description of the light received (and consequently emitted on the other side)
by the wall is simpler than the description of the exchange of light
between the two sides. This is first because photons do not interact with each
other, and because I assume that I can represent the light flux in a compact
yet precise way (guess what I will use?). Now of course the problem is that 
some of the light reaching one side will bounce back to illuminate the other
side, and so on.. If we assume that the light effects are linear (not always
true in the vast physical world, but if we cannot assume this, "radiosity"
and "ray-tracing" are also dead in the water), all we have to do is repeat
the process. How many times? Well first we can wait until each side has settled
down and only then sent the result to the other side. But then (especially after
the emitters on each side have been taken care of) the amount of energy
(actually power in a steady state) can only decrease, guaranteeing convergence.
How fast? Well, consider a situation where 20% (quite generous) of the light
received from one side is sent back to the other side. The fraction left
after N trips across is of course 5^-N, which is a respectable convergence rate.
Can you say "divide and conquer"? I knew you could.
In practice we do not create a single wall, but subdivide adaptively
the world according to the amount of undistributed power it has and the
complexity of the scene it contains (that's where the octree comes in).

Peter Schroeder mentions visibility, and indeed it is a pesky problem. But
note that we have only local visibility problems here. We don't care to know
if objects not in the same cell can see each other or not. If they can't
their light ain't there, but we do not know that explicitly. Note that
if we have a closet full of junk that does not receive any light, we do not
even look at them (I exaggerate slightly, it depends on where the cells' 
boundaries fall). Note also that it looks like the old Warnock algorithm
for visibility (in spirit, not in practice).

Jorge Stolfi mentioned the fact that the light coming from groups of Lambertian
diffusers is not distributed like from a single planar Lambertian diffuser.
Indeed, but we are not restricted in any way to Lambertian diffusers (which
is good, since they are so rare in captivity). In fact the less diffuse the
light is the better it is for this approach in some sense (I must point out
the Lazlo Neumann (& Neumann) has a wonderful study of various situations
for the distribution of reflected light in the standard approaches to
global illumination and what to do about it, to appear in TOG soon, I hope).
Jorge's last point about 3-way form factors is precisely the reason the light-
driven approach is attractive, since we do not have to consider explicitly the
exchanges between cells, let alone between objects. 

Per Christensen's point about "approximate" visibility is well taken. No matter
how well you represent the light flux at the cell boundary, an adversary
can set up scenes where you are very wrong (the adversary just has to know
if there is a band-limit to the representation, and set up two parallel
venetian blinds above the limit frequency, which can either block all the light
or let about half of it pass). But any method based on finite representations
is vulnerable to such tricks. That does not mean that we should not be careful,
though. Let me reiterate that in our model the cells do not represent groups
of objects, but only provide boundaries at which to represent the light flux.

Thank you also to people like Nelson Max and Greg Ward who pointed at the
Integra system and Fujimoto as a possible source for a similar approach;
Jorge Stolfi also pointed at work by Leo Guibas and Veach. I will follow these
leads.

I am gathering some old stuff we wrote about this, together with more current
stuff. The history is that Eugene Fiume and I started to work on this around
1988 in Toronto (with Marc Ouellette and Chuan Chee), submitted a paper to
Siggraph '89, got rejected, resubmitted in 1990, same fate. Paradoxically
a paper on a parallel implementation of the scheme (with George Drettakis and
Eugene Fiume) was accepted and published at Eurographics '90. At UBC
we shifted to a wavelet representation for light flux (with Bob Lewis),
submitted a paper to the Eurographics workshop on rendering, again to no avail.
We will post a decent draft on the web asap. Note that we have not submitted
anything about this to sigwaf this year, so there is no danger of interfering
with the blind review process.

Last point for now: much to my dismay it makes global illumination amenable
to an Object-Oriented approach.

Abstract

This paper illustrates that there are conferences which will destroy
confidence in scientific life if the community does not forbid them. The
Wessex Institute of Technology (UK) [1] organizes a whole series of regular
conferences on various topics [2]. Our experiences are only with one of
these, "VIDEA", but one should probably also be careful with the others. It
is an offense against honorable scientists to offer false publication
possibilities under a scientifically serious disguise for high fees. Our
conclusion is: VIDEA accepts EVERYTHING! And we conclude from that that a
publication in the VIDEA proceedings is worth NOTHING AT ALL! And to
organize such a conference is simply a fraud. Conferences like VIDEA are a
morally dispisable scheme to allow people to buy themselves publications
without having to undergo any type of reviewing. It simply increases the
flow of worthless data and makes it more difficult for scientists to
extract really useful information


Introduction

Serious conferences usually introduce themselves by distributing a "Call
for Papers" including a submission deadline. After having received
contributions a technical program committee reviews and evaluates these to
come to a decision which of the submitted paper proposals shall be accepted
for the conference. Some conferences ask for abstracts first to be able to
decide whether a topic is appropriate for their event, and ask for full
papers (to be reviewed again) only thereafter.

This holds also for a conference called "Visualization and Intelligent
Design in Engineering and Architecture" (VIDEA'93). Having accepted to
become a member of the program committee for VIDEA'93, one of the authors
made two suspicious observations. Firstly, he received exactly zero
abstracts and zero papers to review, and was never informed about any
program committee meetings nor of any reviewing results. The program for
the conference was finished apparently without involvement of the
scientific advisory committee. We recognized this by receiving the printed
advance program. Secondly, we submitted three papers to this conference,
and they were all accepted without any comments, grades, or whatsoever.
Meaningless to say that the visit to this conference was very disappointing
both in the sense of contents and in the sense of organization.

When two of the authors were asked to become members of the program
committee for VIDEA'95 (to take place in La Coruna, Spain), we planned to
test if any reviews take place at all. We would send them four abstracts
that are obviously plain nonsense, that no excuse for accepting them could
be taken seriously. This paper reports about this activity.


The submitted abstracts

We decided to write more than one crazy abstract to make sure that an
acceptance cannot be interpreted as accident and so we tried different
types of weird papers proposals. The first of four abstracts we produced
was simply a completely irrelevant topic, namely how to create footprints
on the walls of public rooms. It includes several statements that every
reviewer must recognize as joke. The complete text is given in abstract 1.

The Footprint Function for
the Realistic Texturing of Public Room Walls

Abstract
Today's radiosity methods are able to produce nearly perfect light
distributions for interior rooms. Unrealistic appearance now mainly is due
to missing texturing of the walls. One important feature of public room
walls are footprints in the lower areas. This paper presents a set of
simple functions to easily generate a class of footprint textures for such
applications. Different randomization techniques ensure the realistic
appearance of the results. This technique is of increasing importance for
the visualization of architectural objects in the future.
Keywords
realism, rendering, textures, footprints

Introduction
Today's radiosity methods are able to produce nearly perfect light
distributions of interior rooms. Unrealistic appearance now mainly is due
to missing texturing of the walls. One important feature of public room
walls are footprints in the lower areas.

The Footprint Function
The basic footprint function is a combination of trivial, i.e. easy to
implement, parametric functions. The footprint is divided into a ball and a
heel which can have independent sole textures. The sizes are chosen such
that a simulation of shoe sizes 35 to 42 for women profiles and 39 to 46
for men profiles is performed.

Randomization Techniques
Distribution techniques will be presented that ensure that the lower part
of the wall contains significantly more footprints than the higher parts.
Especially, no footprints must occur above a certain threshold height, due
to physiological limitations of the human being. Additionally, random
functions will take care that most footprints remain incomplete and vary in
color and shape.

Results
Preliminary investigations are encouraging. As we have not implemented the
new method yet, there are no concrete results, yet. The final paper might
include images.

Conclusion
A footprint function for the realistic imaging of walls is presented.
Details of all functions are given to ensure an easy implementation for the
reader.

The second abstract describes a correct method which makes no sense at all,
that is how to render interior rooms without light. Obviously, the
resulting image will be completely black. This was written as in abstract
2.

Efficient Radiosity for Daylight Simulation in Closed Environments

Introduction
Radiosity is a useful tool for architects and lighting engineers to
simulate illumination in the interior of buildings. Unfortunately, the
computation time for radiosity is very high. However, radiosity algorithms
can take advantage of special scene properties of specific classes of
environments. Exploiting the additional information about the scene
structure of a particular class can decrease the computation time
significantly. The aim of this paper is to speed up the radiosity
computation for the class of closed environments without artificial light
sources.

Two Restrictions on the Scene Structure
The first restriction on the scene is that it is closed. The reason for
this restriction is the fact that radiosity is based upon the energy
conservation principle, that means that at any time the amount of emitted
energy equals the amount of absorbed energy plus the amount of energy
leaving the scene. In closed scenes no energy leaves the scene, thus
simplifying the radiosity computation. However, this restriction does not
impose problems, because radiosity is mostly used for interior scenes.
The second restriction is that only daylight can be considered. Radiosity
algorithms solve a set of equations, where the radiosities of patches are
the unknowns and the emissions are the constant terms. In conventional
radiosity all patches are allowed to emit light, i.e. to be an artificial
light source. If we assume that no patch has emission, we only have to
consider daylight. This allows the use of very efficient solution methods
known in numerical mathematics for the set of equations. The second
restriction does not limit the range of applications too much as well,
because in most cases architects are interested in visualizing their design
with daylight conditions.

Mathematical Foundation of the New Method
Details will be described in the final paper.

Benefits
The new method reduces the computation time of both the radiosity
evaluation and of image generation. Images can be generated at interactive
rates even for very complex scenes, making the method suitable for
walk-throughs and VR-applications. Since numerical techniques are mainly
replaced by analytical formulas, no aliasing effects appear.

Conclusion and Future Work
The development of radiosity algorithms for special classes of scenes is a
promising field of future research. Such algorithms are significantly
faster and possibly more accurate than non-specialized algorithms.

(end extended abstract 2)


These first two productions have at least a little bit the structure of a
scientific paper abstract. What we also wanted to try was, if VIDEA would
accept its own text as abstract. So we copied the complete introduction
from the "Call for Papers" and gave this abstract the title of the
conference. Minor changes were only made like changing the word
"conference" to "paper". The result is given in abstract 3.


Extended abstract 3:

Visualization and Intelligent Design in Engineering  and Architecture

Abstract
In recent years, remarkable advances in computer visualization of objects
and physical phenomena have been made. Computer images can now represent
real objects very accurately. These techniques can be enhanced by defining
any desired path, creating animation, moving computer views and real world
video models, as well as sound tracks, resulting in multimedia
representations. The development of these techniques has been possible
because of the improvements in computer graphic devices, better algorithms
and faster processors, which allow workstations and high speed PCs to be
suitable platforms for visualization and have greatly improved the ability
of high-performance computers to produce computer images, in animated
forms, of complex engineering and architecture problems allowing a dynamic
analysis of their behavior.
Visualization has been essential for the development of new design
techniques in engineering and architecture. The integration of computer
visualization with other advances in computer computational sciences, such
as knowledge based support systems, object bases, advance numerical
methods, etc. provide the basis for intelligent design systems.
The objective of this paper is to discuss advances in visualization as a
tool for intelligent design in engineering and architecture. The paper aims
to bring together research in computational mathematics and industrial
hardware and software, as well as science, engineering and architecture for
developing practical applications in these various fields. A presentation
of our results on workstations with graphic peripherals and personal
computers will be available to the audience.
---------------------------------------------------------
(end extended abstract 3)


Last but not least we decided to produce an abstract without any content,
just complete nonsense. So we took a dictionary of information processing
words and selected randomly some 40 phrases from there and joined them
together to a fantastically technical sounding text. The given reference
is, of course, the utilized dictionary! We had much fun with abstract 4.


Extended abstract 4:
---------------------------------------------------------
Distributed Multiprogramming System
for Pen Selectors with Error Probability

Extended Abstract
Controllable connections for input/output supervisor channel adapters with
line frequency scanning are often used for unavailable time. This paper
describes the use of disturbance voltage with equivalent junction
temperature as OP-trade-in for zone packed print.

The main advantage over previous methods are the data transmission lines
and routine conversion. Addressing, relative to preferred characters, uses
a magnetic disk machine to enable incremental programming. The identifier
transmission group correlates to non transmitting typewriters.

Statistically spoken, manufacturing control and messages are mixed so that
the primary supervisor may be located in different physical records. A
collection of data is defined as the unit of transfer between the program
and format management.

The theory is based on arithmetic overflow, qualified names, and axial lead
resistors. Using the Sparbuchdrucker-theorem [1] modified by ledger
adjustment sales in combination with a secondary operator control station
allows the number of single machines to roll over the keyboard. The basic
origin coordinates ensure a diminished radix complement. In the future this
generalized sequential access method will be the source for forced control
field lines.

Results
All abstracts were sent to the conference in November 1994 and on January
14th, 1995 we received the results. All four abstract have been "reviewed
and provisionally accepted"! This means, that the VIDEA conference
organizers [3] claim someone has reviewed these abstracts and has found
them suitable for the conference! As members of the program committee two
of us had nothing to do with reviewing.

The acceptance letter also contains information from which can be concluded
that final papers will only be printed in the proceedings if the
registration fee is paid together with the final paper. Additionally, the
letter states "Due to the success of the conference and to be fair, we can
only allow each participant to present one paper at the meeting which will
be published in the proceedings" which makes sure that every published
paper is paid for by a registration fee. The publisher (Elsevier) probably
doesn't have the slightest idea that they are printing non-reviewed
material as high-quality books.


Conclusions

We believe that Wessex Institute of Technology (or at least some people
there) profit in a very dirty way from the international pressure on
scientists to have long publication lists. They pretend to organize
scientific conferences by giving them the look of such events. They use the
names of the program committee members for economical purposes only. They
"sell" publication possibilities to less experienced or naive members of
our community and in this way ruin their work by producing a worthless
publication. It is very dangerous to tolerate such developments. This would
ruin the seriousness of our scientific culture.

The effects of this little test definitely must be that this conference of
the Wessex Institute of Technology is abandoned and ignored in the future
and that the names of its organizers [3] are watched very carefully for
their future actions. We will resign from the program committee immediately
and try to warn all other program committee members and authors of accepted
papers.

Another effect of such scandals should be that the length of the
publication lists of scientists must not become so important. Rather than
that, other evaluation measures that emphasize quality instead of quantity
should be internationally further encouraged. Only by reducing the pressure
to produce lots of papers can the danger of such unmoral events be reduced.
One positive side-effect would be a reduced intellectual pollution in some
fields.

A third aspect is how scientifically serios institutions can find support
in the organization of local conferences. We want to strongly recommend to
contact the established scientific associations of your field to ensure
serious support, e.g. the national computer societies, or specialized
associations for specific fields. They usually can help with publicity,
financing, and high quality publications.


Important Note

We believe that Wessex Institute of Technology is fully responsible for
this affair, and that both the university cite where VIDEA shall take place
and the publisher who will produce the proceedings are fooled in the same
way as the participants.

Werner,

I have heard of this sort of thing in the psychological literature,
but only journals, not conferences. 

It certainly seems that there was an intent to deceive here, as a
technical committee was recruited and advertised but apparently
completely ignored.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm sure that tenure
committees will be on the lookout.

-Stephen

P.S. I can't wait to see the full paper for Abstract 4!

Congratulations to Professor Purgathofer et al. for making my day with the
most hilarious paper abstract I've read in quite some time.  I admit to
not quite sharing their sense of moral outrage, which isn't to be taken
as condoning the actions of the VIDEA organisers.  On a weekly basis,
I get invitations to write chapters for books.  Some of them are from
very reputable people, but a lot of these invitations would charge *you*
money for publication; obviously these too are scams.

Perhaps there are misguided academics out there who believe that padding
their CV's with this kind of filler is helpful, but this is the first
thing that is noticed in peer review for grants and in tenure review
for ... you know what.

Furthermore, and this is consonant with what Alain said a few weeks
back, we need more fora (proper plural just to please Fournier) in
which half-done and half-baked ideas can be presented and even written
up.  We do have to identify them as such, and even such a workshop
should have a properly functioning review committee.  But I would hate
to see our outrage with pseudoconferences like VIDEA undermine earnest
attempts at promoting new research ideas and fora.

Cheers all,
Eugene.

I'm afraid I come in on the side of moral outrage here.  I agree that
reasonably informed review committees are unlikely to pay attention to
such listings on a vita (or even *downgrade* a person who would try to
misrepresent them).  And I have no problem with the idea of more fora
for work in progress.  The SPIE sponsored Electronic Imaging Symposium
has a track ("conference") on Data Visualization that I regard as this
sort of forum.  The Volume Visualization and Parallel Rendering
Symposiums started as this kind of workshop.  And the net itself seems
to be a good place for some of this activity.  My outrage is in
empathy for those researchers whose good names have been used by VIDEA
to further their misleading activity.

At the very least, the "program committee chair" should have notified
the rest of the committee that so few papers were received that all
were being accepted and no reviews were needed.  And the conference
should stop using the names of those who did no work.  At least upon
receipt of such notice the "program committee members" could request
that their names be removed from promotional materials.  Since they
received no such notice, the chance to request removal slips by.

The experiment clearly shows that the VIDEA organizers are irresponsible
and I certainly wish to avoid having my name associated with them.

-----------------------------------------------------
In short: WIT organises a conference (VIDEA'95, 12-14 June) which they
claim to be reviewed, but we believe it isn't. After VIDEA'93 we already
had some doubts, and so we tested what would happen with four complete
nonsense submissions. They were all "provisionally accepted". As members of
the Scientific Advisory Committee we were not involved in a reviewing
process. We feel that our names were only misused to give the conference a
serious appearance.

After some general explanations we will comment some of the more severe
accusations in Prof. Brebbia's responses (marked with ">"). You can find
the complete responses and all other reactions from the scientific
community on our WWW-server:

First we want to point out that this should not be a personal attack
against anybody. Our aim was only to discourage the organisation of
expensive non-reviewed conferences, where participants not only spend a lot
of money but also waste their creative work for non-reviewed publications.

We don't want to comment the seriousness of accepting submissions purely
based on the institution they come from. It is, however, worth noticing
that one of the submissions was sent from the fictive "Styrian Advanced
Naval Research" institution with an unknown author name, from which it is
impossible to recognise a connection to our institute. This abstract was
also "reviewed" and provisionally accepted.

>In addition they submitted papers of good quality to
>VIDEA/93 which were published in the conference book.

Maybe one of the initial reasons to publicize our observations was that we
had lost three good quality papers into a non-reviewed book.

>The authors, being experienced people,
>would have been aware that the conference would
>provisionally accept abstracts from advisory board members
>and their colleagues.  They also knew that any spoof
>abstracts would be unlikely to be discovered until the

If even spoof abstracts are not detected during reviewing, what is the
whole process good for? And our experience tells us that all submissions
are handled equally at serious conferences, no matter where they come from.

>We totally refute the allegation regarding the quality
>of the conferences associated with Wessex Institute of
>Technology and by implication the researchers and other
>institutions associated with the conferences. (...) we
>have received many messages of support from colleagues
>throughout the world which we very much appreciate.

We have also received many messages, and from some of them we can draw the
conclusion that many other WIT conferences seem to be organised in a much
more scientific manner than VIDEA, but there are also critical comments on
other WIT conferences. We hope that in each single case the situation is
clear to the involved people. Any damage, however, has to be blamed on the
organisers of VIDEA.

Another aspect is the "final paper reminder" we received, telling us that
the paper cannot be accepted for the proceedings if not sent by 27 March,
including a message "We will also require (...) payment to accompany your
paper".

>(...)  The International Scientific Community is well
>aware of this and our conference proceedings have always
>reached a substantial number of sales, including the >proceedings of VIDEA/93.

This is the point were we have to make clear that the first version of our
story contains a slight incorrectness. The co-publishers of the VIDEA'93
proceedings were "Computational Mechanics Publications" and "Elsevier".
>From this we (wrongly) concluded that Elsevier would also be involved in
publishing the '95 proceedings, which Elsevier commented: "The
copublication agreement we had with CMP
lasted from 1991 to 1993, and we no longer have any involvement with their
book publications.  I should emphasise that this discontinuation was for
commercial reasons alone."

>As far as I can remember we have never received a
>complaint about the quality of our conference proceedings
>but rather numerous messages of congratulation and
>complimentary reviews in the scientific literature,
>including a message from Dr Groeller, saying
>that he found VIDEA/93 interesting and that he wanted
>his name to be included in the Scientific Advisory
>Committee!

First Eduard Groeller was invited by Prof. Brebbia for an invited talk and
to become a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee. Due to our
experiences with VIDEA'93 he reacted "Due to tight travel budget
limitations I can only give an invited talk if travel expenses and
conference fees are paid by the organising committee" and was thereafter
cancelled from the publized committee without further notice. This was the
moment when we decided to test VIDEA for its seriousness. So he wrote a
flattery email to Prof. Brebbia, trying to find out why he was removed. The
answer was "...your name has been erased because you were unable to attend
the meeting. I will now see that it appears in the next Call for Papers".

>We do not understand the motives of these people and we
>find their action offensive, as it abuses the trust we all
>place in our colleagues in the International Scientific
>community. (...)  If this type of behavior was repeated
>by others the foundation of our scientific knowledge
>base would be undermined.

The key question is, who abuses the trust of the International Scientific
community.

A few days later Prof. Brebbia wrote:
>I understand now why Prof. Purgathofer et al. have
>decided to behave so maliciously (...)
> (...) a meeting to be held in Dublin
>from the June 12-14 1995 which has been co-organized

Believe it, or not: we have completely overseen this date collision until
Prof. Brebbia wrote the above message, because we never planned to attend
VIDEA'95 and therefore never looked at the date close enough. Luckily,
Werner Purgathofer is only Program Co-Chair for the Dublin event
(Eurographics Rendering Workshop) and has nothing to do with its
organisation. Especially, any loss/profit has to be carried by others. The
Rendering Workshop accepts a limited number of participants on a first
come/first serve basis and had never had problems to reach this limit in
past years. And the participants lists of VIDEA'93 and the Rendering
Workshop'94 are disjoint but three persons, two of which are from our
institute. So VIDEA was not even a competing event.

And Prof. Brebbia is right: if we would have tried to sabotage VIDEA'95 for
this reason, this would have been highly unethical. But how could we be
that silly?

>All members of the Scientific Advisory Committee were sent
>a letter asking them for support and suggestions.
>Although we did not specifically mention the reviewing of
>abstracts in the letter, they are expected to help during
>the review process if necessary.

As a member of this committee for the last VIDEA'93 Werner Purgathofer
never received anything to review. And here are excerpts from reactions of
two other (prominent) Scientific Advisory Committee members. 1) "For VIDEA
'95, I don't know why we are in the committee and of course, we did not
receive any paper to review." 2) "They have once more put my name on their
'international committee' for this year's event, but I have heard nothing
about reviewing papers."

Summarizing, there might be areas in which non-refereed conferences are the
normal case. This is certainly less true for several Computer Science
areas. But the fact is that a conference which is announced to be reviewed
("all abstracts and final manuscripts submitted ... will be refereed ...")
must really do so. WIT is selling a product where the declaration of its
contents is wrong. And we believe that it is not only our right but our
obligation to warn the scientific community of such circumstances.

Remains to discuss one remark we received: "[in former days a] standard
said, that no member of a program committee (advisory board as well?)
should ever submit a paper, or if he did, he should immediately resign from
the committee." This would make it quite unattractive to become a member of
such a committee. In our opinion the integrity of all involved people
should assure that such papers are handled completely equally as all
others. Or are we wrong?

-----------------------------------------------------
And finally an open letter to Prof. Brebbia:

Prof. Brebbia,
we believe we should not let this discussion escalate too much. We have
learned a lot about you and your conferences during the last weeks. It is
clear to us that a manager who has to take care of many things cannot have
under control every detail. Although from the reactions we conclude that
some of your conferences seem to fulfill the usual standards, you cannot
declare that VIDEA does.

We want to propose a way out of this dilemma which minimizes harm to
people, institutions, and events not involved at all in the discussed
topic. If you continue to declare that all your conferences are of equal
quality, you will ruin the others also. You know as well as we do that our
statements about VIDEA are true and it would be much better for you to
confess this now than to get it proven by us during some legal process. At
the same time you should do everything to ensure that none of your other
conferences is organised in the way VIDEA was.

To be fair to you, we have now put on our www-server
     http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/~wp/videa.html
not only our story, but also all responses we received during the last 2
weeks, including all of your messages we got a copy of. All this stuff is
only anonymised, without any additional censorship. From this, it must
become clear to you that every additional step you take in the wrong
direction will continue to destroy your image.

< summary-- I want feedback on a proposed definition for "radiosity method">

Because of some comments in some siggraph reviews I have been
researching the definition of "radiosity method".  There are 
four obvious candidates given the usage I have seen:

1. A FE method for lambertian scenes.

2. A solution that somehow uses linear equations to represent light
   transport in a lambertain scene.

3. A FE method for global illumination (would include Sillion et a. '91).

4. An algorithm that computes view-independent illumination information.

I have problems with all of these definitions.  For example, if I use 
definition 1, is Pattanaik's thesis code a radiosity method in an all
diffuse scene?  Probably not, but I think most of us would want to call
it a radiosity method.  And how about Sillion and Puech '89?  There are
mirrors in their work-- is it radiosity?

Jim Arvo has proposed a definition I want to float:

  A radiosity method computes radiosity (or irradiance) for
  at least some surfaces in the scene.

This definition will encompass both FE and MC methods that compute
quantities for the diffuse surfaces in a scene.  It would
not include Sillion et al. '91 (which could be a "radiance" method
I suppose).

Reactions?

< summary-- feedback on a proposed definition for "radiosity method">

I tend to think of a "radiosity method" whenever information is
computed and attached to the surfaces, thus it includes illumination
maps and 'light path tracing', as well as techniques where  lambertian or 
directional radiant information is exchanged with form factors.

In fact, I realize that any method that stores *some* radiant
information is for me *a* radiosity method. *The* radiosity
method, on the other hand, should be reserved for Lambertian
surfaces with form factors etc...

I think it is a pity to have inherited such a name (radiosity
is not a method, but a radiant quantity), and I personally oppose
the use of the similar 'radiance' method. 

I vote for item # 4 in your list:

How about "radiosity is some kind of method that has something to do with
computing light and stuff."

As far as I'm concerned, overuse of the term has made it next to meaningless
at this point.  It started out as a unit of diffuse radiation leaving a
surface, which was pretty useless to begin with, and it went downhill.
I vote we drop it.  It is not now nor has it ever been descriptive of the
finite element flux transfer techniques to which it's been applied.

I tempted to agree with Francois in liking #4 the best, but it's too general.
It can contain things that we don't want to call radiosity, like systems that
decimate the world into cubes and do physical optics, propagating
wavefronts from cube to cube.  That's so far in spirit from the original
use of radiosity that the term becomes so vague as to be useless.  I'd
reserve "radiosity" for FE methods like #3 (though Francois is right
that it's not even such a good word for that).  The problem is that as
different things are added to the basic ideas of classical radiosity, the term
seems to need to grow to accomodate them all.

Maybe we can take a cue from the filter folks (with IIR and FIR filters)
and refer to view-dependent illumination and view-independent
illumination as VDI and VII algorithms; then classical radiosity algorithms are
a subclass of the VII algorithms.  So Radiance implements a VII method,
but it's not radiosity.

As Seth pointed out, new acronyms are tricky.  When I said that
Radiance is VII, I meant the part that deposits little diffuse packets on
surfaces.  This is driven, in part, by a VDI algorithm.  Another reason,
perhaps, why we ought not to let one term grow to encompass everything.

Call me a traditionalist, but I prefer to think of radiosity methods (plural) as
finite element methods. They were in use as such for over 50 years before they
were appropriated for computer graphics applications, and were called "radiosity
methods" by Sparrow way back in 1963. It seems rather presumptuous to be
fiddling with the basic definition some thirty years later to suit our
particular needs.

I see no particular problem with incorporating nondiffuse surfaces within the
definition of radiosity methods. This allows for Pete's third definition, "an FE
method for global illumination." However, adding Monte Carlo ray tracing to the
definition (via Jim Arvo's proposal) may not be a good idea. One objection is
that this would conflict with the similar definition of "radiative flux
transfer" in the illumination engineering community. We lighting nerds clearly
(and sometimes passionately) distinguish radiative transfer methods from Monte
Carlo ray tracing techniques.

The variety of global illumination algorithms we now have clearly calls for some
sort of reasoned taxonomy to describe and classify them. Whatever this may be,
however, I would argue that we should not attempt to redefine "radiosity
methods" beyond that commonly understood within the computer graphics, thermal
engineering, illumination engineering, and acoustic engineering communities.

Ah, the thrill of lexicography!
We all realize that there will not be any definition that satisfies our
understanding of an expression like "radiosity method", or any expression
that covers exactly what we mean by any definition that would satisfy
our understanding of it, if it were to exist. I hope I made myself clear.

But seriously, folks...
Things only mean what we say they mean. Take "finite element" for example.
There is no way you would know what that means just looking at it, and
even after hearing a definition (try one that does not take two pages
and/or does not include just about everything that is computed) you
still are not too sure what it starts and where it ends.
The safest for us is that whenever we use an expression like "radiosity" we
briefly say what we mean by it --in the particular context where it is used--.
I had to do this recently because I wrote about using "arbitrary" BRDFs
within the "classic" radiosity approach. In this context I called the
classic radiosity approach "linear radiosity", thus approaching very closely
definition 2. of Peter, except that surfaces are not necessarily Lambertian.
Obviously "linear" here refers to the system of equations obtained.
I actually like the use of the synecdoche for "radiosity", as long as we don't
forget that anything that computes illumination in a useful way will have
to be able to compute radiosity --the radiometric quantity.

Few more things. I agree with Ian that we owe it to the other communities
not to change arbitrarily the meaning of expressions they have been using
for a while. I disagree with him about needing a taxonomy. To paraphrase
Sam Goldwyn ("verbal agreements are not worth the paper they are written on"),
taxonomies are usually not worth the theory they are not based on (I have
indulged in the past, but I don't have to be consistent). 
Recently at a "PhD Thesis Proposal" (one of the events we cherish here in our
department), the "candidate" was attacked because he used the word
"illumination" in his title. The objection was that illumination
is a quantity, not a topic or an area of research. Of course it used to be a
quantity, but it never was only that, and it is now "deprecated", as they
say, as a quantity. The candidate replied too politely. There are times
when a graduate student should be able to tell a full prof that he is full
of it (OK, maybe that was NOT the time...).

In conclusion: we have to be as clear as possible, but not clearer.

Thanks for the interesting responses so far!

Here are three methods that estimate "radiosity" in
a view-ind. manner:

    1. Wallace: uses explicit patch-to-patch ray tracing
                and solves linear system.

    2. Airey: uses Malley-style form factor computation using
              random directional ray shooting.

    3. Pattanaik: uses photon-like particle walks and counts
                  collisions with "zones" on the surfaces.

I think 1 and 2 are FE methods.  Number 3 is probably not
under most definitions (e.g. Cohen and Wallace's book).  But
2 and 3 are SO close conceptually and in code.  The biggest
difference is that in 2 a particle can leave the patch from
a slightly different location than it hits.  I am very
uncomfortable with a definition of "radiosity method" that
includes only one of 2 or 3.

I also think we will confuse heat transer and illumination
engineering people if we include methods such as Sillion et al. '91
which might never compute a "radiosity" anywhere.

Pete

PS-- one thing I AM sure of now-- the is NOT an accepted definition.
This is something we should take care of culturally (rather than
"officially") or we are doing a great disservice to future graphics
people.

I'd like to offer a few thoughts on the use of the term "radiosity".  The 
gist of my argument is that the simplest definition of the term seems to be
most useful; making it more general or more specific causes problems.

I advocate the following definition (which Pete Shirley already tossed out):

    A "radiosity algorithm" is an algorithm that generates radiosity-like 
    quantities associated with surfaces (i.e. power per unit area, or the 
    photometric equivalent) based on radiative transfer.

Note that there is no reference to how this is done, whether all the surfaces
are Lambertian, or whether there is any dependence on the view.  The latter 
distinctions can be made by context or by attaching modifiers.  As a very 
crude analogy, consider sorting algorithms.  Any algorithm that generates a 
sorted list of things is a sorting algorithm, regardless of how it is done.  
If the "how" is important, then we may specify "quick sort", "heap sort", etc.

Before getting into the real argument, I'd like to propose some rationale
for why we invent terminology in the first place.  It seems to me that a
bit of terminology will catch on (and improve our lives) if it is

    1) unambiguous  (makes a clear distinction)

    2) convenient   (concise and makes a useful distinction)

    3) self evident (agrees with intuition and/or common usage)

Clearly these will often conflict, so it's not always possible to satisfy 
them all.  In general, we try to satisfy these criteria by using short 
pithy terms for large classes of things (or extremely fundamental things), 
and attaching modifiers to call out specific sub-categories.

I believe that the above definition of a radiosity algorithm is a good one
with respect to these criteria.  If the term "radiosity" is made more specific, 
such as by limiting it to finite element methods, then we shall need to 
1) agree upon what a finite element method is, and 2) refrain from calling 
anything a radiosity method if it is not a finite element method.  I believe 
there are problems on both counts.

    Consider the method developed by both Pattanaik and Shirley, which 
    estimates radiosities on discrete elements via random walks.  Is this a 
    Monte Carlo method or a finite element method?  If you focus on the path 
    tracing, it is Monte Carlo.  If you focus on (the expected values of) the 
    estimated quantities, it is a Galerkin finite element method.  Whether it 
    is classified as a "radiosity" method should not (in my opinion) depend on 
    which aspect you deem most relevant.

    As a second example, consider Hanrahan's original hierarchical radiosity
    method -- a Galerkin approach with constant elements.  I believe there 
    is universal agreement that this should be called a "radiosity" method.
    However, the form factors are computed using Monte Carlo, so one could
    argue that it is actually a Monte Carlo method (after all, it makes
    calls to "rand", right?).  Is it therefore NOT a radiosity method?

    As a third example, consider an algorithm based on the Nystrom method:
    that is, a method that replaces the integral operator with a quadrature 
    rule based on point-to-point transfers (i.e. no form factors).  This is a
    deterministic method that is not a finite element method.  However, it is
    very much like a finite element method.  I would really like to call it
    "Nystrom radiosity" if what it computes is radiosity.  Does this not seem
    very appropriate?

    As a final example, consider a hypothetical algorithm that can transform
    a simple scene (such as the "Cornell box") into an equivalent problem with
    an analytic solution.  I know of no such algorithm, but I would not
    hesitate to call it a radiosity algorithm since it solves the same type 
    of problem (albeit, without any type of projection onto an approximating
    subspace, which is inherent in finite element methods).


In view of the above, I feel that including "finite element" in the definition of 
a radiosity method fails on two counts: 

    1) it is ambiguous, since it depends on which aspect of the problem you deem 
       most important (sometimes we choose to ignore the Monte Carlo aspect, and
       sometimes we don't), and 

    2) it fails to make a useful distinction.  Because of an historical accident
       (finite element methods came along first) it separates methods that seem 
       to belong together because of their *function*.  If it's important to 
       distinguish the "how", it's easy to do so by adding a modifier like "finite 
       element", "stochastic", "Nystrom", "analytic", etc.



On the other hand, if the term is made more general by including methods that 
solve for surface radiance functions, then just about everything becomes a radiosity 
algorithm.  I feel that we then lose a very useful distinction.  I believe that one 
of the most fundamental distinctions among global illumination algorithms is whether 
they generate functions with directional dependence or not.  Since the word "radiosity" 
taken by itself implies that there is no such dependence, the term is self evident only 
if we preserve that connotation; moreover, doing so agrees with most prior usage.

Whether an algorithm is based on Monte Carlo or a finite element method, is 
view-dependent or view-independent, can be cleared up nicely by attaching the 
appropriate modifier when context alone is inadequate.  Here are a few examples, which 
I'm sure will cause some controversy.  I apologize in advance for leaving out so many
references and for using such terse abbreviations -- I've listed just a few 
obvious examples in order to illustrate.  (I hope I got most of these right.)


    Radiosity:

        Any method that produces radiosity (or irradiance, or luminosity)
        as its output.  Examples: [Goral 84] [Cohen 85] [Sillion 89] [Rushmeier 90]
        [Shirley 90] [Pattanaik 90] [Hanrahan 91] [Zatz 93] [Troutman 93] 
        [Gortler 93] [Smits 94]


    View-dependent radiosity:

        Solves for radiosities of visible surfaces, or some closely
        related set of surfaces.  Example: [Smits 92], if importance is driven by the 
        view, and not some other criteria.  Also includes view-dependent path tracing,
        such as [Ward 88].


    Radiosity with non-diffuse surfaces:  ("non-diffuse radiosity" sounds like an oxymoron)

        One that takes non-diffuse transfers into account, but still
        produces only radiosities (or irradiances, or luminosities).
        Examples: [Sillion 89], [Rushmeier 90]


    Radiosity with participating media:

        One that solves for both surface radiosities [watts/m^2] and energy 
        densities [watts/m^3] (the natural analogue of radiosity in a volume).
        Example [Rushmeier 87]
        

    Radiance method:

        An algorithm that produces surface radiance functions (I believe that all are 
        currently view-dependent).  Examples: Ward's RADIANCE system, [Kajiya 86] 
        [Wallace 87] [Sillion 91] [Aupperle 93] (Note that this may involve a 
        "radiosity" first-pass with a view-dependent path tracing second-pass).


    Radiance with participating media:

        One that solves for radiance functions at surfaces and/or in space, with at 
        least one of them having directional variation.  Example: [Max 94]


    Global illumination method:

        Any of the above.


Now, even if everyone were to agree with the above argument (which is HIGHLY unlikely,
I realize :-), we would still not be out of the woods.  Should the definition also be more 
specific about the underlying physics (this was Andrew's point, I believe).  What about 
direct illumination only?  What about classical ray tracing (direct illumination plus 
pure specular chains)?  My feeling is that we want to rule these out, but I'm wary of 
making the definition too specific, so I've not addressed this point (which seems to be
a non-problem anyway).


                                                                           -- Jim Arvo

Subject: Re: Definition of "Radiosity method"?
Status: R

In my opinion, the term "radiosity method" should only be used
for a method that *computes radiosity*.  Why extend the term
"radiosity method" to mean something not computing radiosity?  If we
want to describe global illumination methods, why not be more specific
and describe them as:

1) what they compute (diffuse, glossy, specular, general),
2) the solution method (for example finite elements or Monte Carlo).

For example, a more precise term for the classic radiosity method 
would be "a finite element method for diffuse global illumination".


Jim Arvo proposed:
>  A radiosity method computes radiosity (or irradiance) for
>  at least some surfaces in the scene.

I would favor a definition even more restrictive than this:
a method that computes only radiosity, that is, no directional 
radiance information at all.

With this definition of the term "radiosity method", the following 
classifications result:

Pattanaik's thesis code working in a purely diffuse scene would be a
radiosity method, I would call it "Monte Carlo solution of diffuse
global illumination".  If the scene had some non-diffuse reflection,
it would not be a radiosity method, since the solution could not be
described in terms of just radiosity (but requires radiance).

Sillion et al '91 would not be a "radiosity method" since it computes
directional radiance.  I would describe it as a "finite element method 
for (general) global illumination".  This avoids the term "radiance 
method" which several people dislike.

Sillion and Puech '89 computes radiosity, but intermediate specular
reflections are taken into account,  I would call it something like 
"a finite element method for diffuse and specular global illumination".


The computation method has nothing to do with whether the result is
radiosity or not.

Furthermore, whether the solution is view-dependent has nothing to do 
with whether the method computes radiosity or not.  For example, Smits' 
et al '92 compute view-dependent radiosity solutions (at least the 
accuracy is view-dependent).

Subject: terminology, taxonomy, was defn of "Radioisty"
Status: R

Hi

I am glad this topic came up.

I think taxonomies are really useful. They are a useful guide for people
who want to use an existing method for their application. I'm
prejudiced, but I think a useful taxonomy has been developed in the
NIST Guide to Available Mathematical software (http://gams.nist.gov/).
It helps people sift through all the various software repositories
and find code that will solve their problem.

People in the lighting community have recognized the problem in
terminology and classifying methods. Michael Smith from Lighting
Technologies is heading a CIE technical committee on computer
procedures for lighting metrics and visualization. A major problem
they hope to address is that users have no idea how to choose a lighting
software package based on how it does calculations, because there
is no standard vocabularly to talk about how the calculations are done.
The committee is supposed to present a report that introduces a
standard terminology for describing lighting calculations, gives a
survey of algorithms and description of each, prepates a set of
guidelines for what method should be used for what application, and
produces an extensive set of references.

Anyway, the point of all this is that standards for terminology and
taxonomies are in the works so it is really worthwhile keeping up
the discussion.

1. Agree (but of course this begs the question to define FEM)
2. Disagree - it doesn't bother me to have people to use the title of
Radiosity Methods with appropriate adjectives for non-diffuse environments.
3. Agree - as I think this is part of the definition of (1)

I think about the problem like this. We can (in general) distinguish
between two sets of methods. Those that compute coefficients for basis
functions that are not defines with reference to the view (although the
computation of the coefficients might be). The result would be view
independent (although the accuracy might not). I'm happy to have all these
called radiosity methods (although I would prefer they were all just
called Finite Element Methods).

The second set of methods computes coefficients to basis functions that
are view dependent, i.e., for the light arriving at some region of the image.
These methods I would refer to as Ray Tracing type methods.

I realize this also is not a clean line, for example, where does this place
Greg's Radiance system. I'd call it Ray Tracing based as although there is
some diffuse information deposited in object space, the final computation
of a solution is always in image space.

I find that it is worth it to let the ray go for at least dozens
of bounces before terminating it-- especially for glass panes
(like tabletops).  This way the sides of panes can take on
that colored "look" that makes a big difference in realism.

But what happens when it goes further (as Eric asks?).  I make
it black-- that HAS to be bad.  Should we let these rays go for
hundreds of bounces?  Maybe...

It's a known problem in the diamond-cutting world, that a bad cut diamond
can cause black spots to be visible, due to infinite total internal reflection.
So, it's hard to be sure whether a ray will leave a diamond again.
Theoretically, this could happen after a few thousand internal bounces.

This is also a problem when you want to render an endoscope, used by doctors
to look at your intestines. If you model a glass fiber endoscope, and put
the eyepoint of the ray tracer in front of it, you may want to go for
a large number of bounces to see the things at the other side.

So, basically, there is no way to do it correct, unless you let ray bounce
an infinite number of times.

Back (way back!) when I was interested in proving formal lower bounds
for ray tracing I recall sketching something out that took advantage
of this phenomenon.  But let's go even further back and recall the
immortal words in Turner Whitted's paper:

    For the case of surfaces aligned in such a way that a branch of
    a tree [of ray tracings] has infinite depth, the branch is
    truncated at the point where it exceeds the allotted storage.

I always have loved the chutzpah of that line.

Dear globillum,

Those of you who attended the 6th eurographics workshop in Dublin
know that there is a plan to create a 'consensus document'
summarizing a number of recommendations for terminology
(and possibly notations) to be used in our field.

The outcome of the discussion in Dublin was that people interested
in this discussion should form an informal group and prepare
the document, which will then be discussed by all, with the
goal of an ultimate publication as guidelines for our community.

To get the ball rolling, I would like to hear from you
if you are interested in joining the discussion (it could be
done over globillum, but I fear that this would generate a lot
of noise and bandwith waste, until we have at least a draft of the
document..).
Also, somebody mentioned that there was already a document
(by Holly Rusmeier?) about terminology.. could someone point me
to that document? Thanks..

I have also created a WWW page for the EG working group on
rendering, which many of you know. The page is almost empty
at this point, please check it out if you get a chance and
let me know if you have any suggestions or want to contribute 
something. Any help will be appreciated. For instance if all
organizers of previous rendering workshops could send me 
precise information on how to get the proceedings from their workshop
it would help me a great deal.

Oh, and finally, there is also a globillum WWW page, with
mainly a pointer to the ftp archive of previous discussions.
Again, this was put together very quickly, so please send your
comments if you have any..

I recently re-read the Whitted paper and was shocked to see that
it suggested randomly perturbing reflection vectors on glossy
surfaces.  Cook indeed credited him with the idea in the 84
Siggraph paper.  That paper was full of gems.

I couldn't resist this one. Chris Borel from the Los Alamos National

I know a ray tracer can be written in one line of C source code, but a
radiosity renderer!?!

Status: R

Several weeks ago, David DiLaura posted a message saying that he had
written a paper called "Non-Diffuse Radiative Transfer 2: Planar Area
Sources and Receivers." He indicated where a Postscript copy could be
downloaded from for review.

If you downloaded and read (and understood!) the paper, the Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America has a favor to ask of you. David
will be presenting his paper at the 1995 IESNA Annual Conference in New
York at the end of this month. Following each presentation is an audience
discussion in which the paper is dissected and commented on.

In the case of David's paper, there may not be anyone at the conference
who will be qualified to discuss his work. If so, this will be
unfortunate, because (a) the discussions become part of a presented paper
when (and if) it is published in the Journal of the IES; and (b) I feel
that this is an important piece of work.

If anyone has any comments on the paper, ranging from errors in the
text or mathematics to general comments on the usefulness of this
approach in global illumination applications, the IESNA would very much
like to hear from you.

Any comments will be presented to the audience, and so they should be
400 words or less in length. Submissions that David will need to
respond to are required by July 12th; otherwise, they will be accepted if
received before July 25th.

If you can e-mail or fax your comments to me at:

e-mail:  iashdown@ledalite.com 
Fax:     (604) 888-0566 (Attn: Ian Ashdown)

I will ensure that they are presented at the conference (with full credit
to the authors, of course). On behalf of the IESNA, thanks!

Hello GlobIlluminers!

I have just joined this mailing list (thanks Francois Sillion)
and yesterday I read all previous discussions here. Interesting!

I am working on a radiosityprogram for use within VR-applications.
I hope to finish my master thesis at the end of this summer.
The surfaces that are imported to my program are all NURBS.
I have found three references for curved surfaces within radiosity:
%T A Progressive Radiosity Algorithm for Scenes Containing Curved Surfaces
%J Computer Graphics Forum (Eurographics '93)
%D Sept. 1993

%T A New Radiosity Apporach Using Area Sampling for Parametric Patches
%J Computer Graphics Forum (Eurographics '93)
%D Sept. 1993

%T A Two-Pass Radiosity Method for Bezier Patches
%E K. Bouatouch
%E C. Bouville
%B Photorealism in Computer Graphics (Proceedings Eurographics Workshop
on Photosimulation, Realism and Physics in Computer Graphics, 1990)
%D 1992

But I have not got hold of these articles. Can anyone help?
Anyway, I am sampling (using ray-casting to compute form-factors)
uniformly in uv-space on the NURBS, and then I subdivide adaptively
if needed. Now I was wondering if there is some other technique for
sampling curved surfaces. Has anyone tried sampling uniformly in 3D
instead, that is letting the 3D-distance between a pair of neighbour-points
be constant all over the surface? Or positioning more sample points
in regions of high curvature (although this seems often to be the case
when sampling uniformly in the parametric uv-space for my NURBS) ?
Or any other?
 
I am using my radiosity solutions for VR-applications which means
that I want fast reconstruction of the radiosity functions over
the surfaces. Is everyone using Gouraud-shading for fast radiosity-
reconstruction? 
Sampling uniformly in the uv-space implies a texture map, so I am
generating a texture map containing the radiosities of each surface.
Then I am texture mapping this bitmap onto the surface in order
to reconstruct the radiosity function fast. My machine has no
performance penalty for texture mapping, so it is fast. Also,
another advantage is that you could use the radiosity texture map
with any triangulation of the surface. This is not the case when using
Gouraud shading. Anyone has any comments, faster methods, better methods?
Are these just old ideas?

A last question: do most people use discontinuity meshing nowadays or
are you still using the traditional methods?

Sincerely,
Tomas

Hi Globillumers!

I've just finished my dissertation.  It's entitled

  "Hierarchical Techniques for Glossy Global Illumination"

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:

This dissertation concerns efficient computation of realistic images.
To compute realistic synthetic images, the effect of global
illumination is essential.  Ray tracing algorithms solve the global
illumination problem for specular interreflections, and radiosity
algorithms solve it for diffuse interreflections.  But computing a
solution is more complicated when the surfaces have glossy reflection.

This dissertation describes hierarchical techniques for efficient
solution of the glossy global illumination problem.  Two types of
hierarchy are utilized: wavelets to accurately represent radiance
distributions on surface patches, and clusters to approximately
represent radiant intensity from groups of surface patches.  Without
hierarchical techniques, the solution time would be quadratic in the
number of patches and $O(b^{1.5})$ in the number of basis
functions~$b$.  The hierarchical techniques make solution time linear
in both the number of patches and in the number of basis functions.  
This reduction is significant since the numbers of patches and basis
functions are large for accurate solutions in realistic environments.
Furthermore, directional importance is used to focus refinement of the
solution on parts that contribute significantly to a particular view
of the scene.  

Our method is the first finite-element method capable of handling 
complex glossy scenes.

(cd/m(-2)) to radiance (W/m(-2)/sr).
E.g. a surface has a radiance value of 3183 cd/m(-2). What is
that in W/m(-2)/sr??

Dear globillumers,

As some of you may know, Per Christensen, Eric Stollnitz, David
Salesin and I have been doing some research on extending
clustering to glossy global illumination. Last month we submitted
a paper "Clustering for Glossy Global Illumination" summarizing
our research to ACM TOG. The paper is available online via anonymous
ftp from espresso.cs.washinton.edu under pub/danix/clustering
(ftp://espresso.cs.washinton.edu/pub/danix/clustering on the WWW).

An earlier version of this paper was submitted to Siggraph 95
(and was rejected). Fortunately, the comments of the anonymous
reviewers challenged us to substantially improve both the paper
and the implementation.

The highlights of the results section are: a comparison with
RADIANCE on a glossy "sphereflake" model and nice global illumination
solutions for an architectural environment with ~8000 initial surfaces,
most of which are glossy.

If you happen to read the paper and have any comments, please e-mail
them to me, or we could discuss them at Siggraph.

Thanks,

	Dani

Subject: Siggraph meeting
Status: R

Hello Globillumers,

Well, we just got out of our annual Siggraph lunch meeting, so I thought I
would jot some notes about it while it was still fresh in my overcrowded brain.

There were about 20 of us attending, and I won't embarrass myself by mispelling
(or forgetting) everyone's name, but instead I'll just mention some of the
topics we covered and what was said about them.

1. Sharing models and data

To address need for shared models that are usable and useful for global
illumination, a new format has been developed called MGF (for Materials
and Geometry Format) and models and libraries are now available from:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html

Or, if you only have ftp access, try:

	anonymous@hobbes.lbl.gov	/www/mgf/

This format supports a reasonable reflectance model, CIE XYZ and spectral
colors, and the IES luminaire data format for light sources.  A number of
models from Radiance and other sources have been collected, and we encourage
people with big hearts to add their own models to our collection.  Write
to me if you have any questions or want to get on the mailing list for how
to improve this format to meet our long-term needs.

2. Setting up light sources

Dan Wexler pointed out that one of the biggest time sinks in animation and
rendering for film is the setting up of light sources, and that methods for
making this more interactive were critical to this application.  Specifically,
he felt that a "deep raster" approach (similar to that developed by Sequin
et al and presented at Siggraph 4 years or so ago) was a good way to go.
In general, he felt there needed to be more of an emphasis on animation and
interaction than there was in our current focus on static environments and
generating one really nice image.

3. Image-based rendering

Pete Shirley addressed a general question to the group about the relative
importance and promise of image-based rendering (ala Quicktime VR) versus
polygon-based methods.  The overall response seemed to indicate that indeed
image interpolation was a significant direction to head in the future,
though polygon rendering will continue to be important when object
manipulatin is required and for nearby objects.  It seemed that at
least five people there were actively pursuing such techniques.  (Check
out this year's Siggraph proceedings on Plenoptic Modeling and
Quicktime VR, also Nimeroff et al in Eurographics Rendering Workshop '95.)

4. Visibility processing

Several people talked about the difficulty of geometric simplification and
other statistical or computational geometry methods for detecting visibility
changes or approximating visibility.  Christine Piatko of NIST reminded folks
that tracking visibility is an O(N^6) problem and not something you want to do
explicitly, and there was an interesting paper by Francois Sillion and George
Drettakis (similar in some respects to the one Francois presented at EGRW
this June) on approximating shadows.  Jeff Nimeroff of UPenn also mentioned
the work he had done with Julie Dorsey and Holly Rushmeier and presented at
EGRW on statistical measures of object visibility for looking at this problem.
It was agreed by most that statistical measures or simplification were
necessary in large environments, though there is still much work to be done
in this area.

5. Calibrated input and output

Holly Rushmeier (who by the way is next year's Siggraph papers chair)
talked a little about the difficulty of obtaining accurate physical
data from real-world scenes, and a number of people lamented about the
undetermined nature of image-to-output mappings for computer monitors,
printers and film recorders.  It was suggested that these devices be
measured, which is certainly possible, and that this data be shared
with the larger community.  (Hear, hear, let's all do it, etc.)
Holly and I also reminded people to look at the conference room image
measurements and model we have made available on the web site:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/compare.html

>From there, you can also pick up an online copy of our EGRW '95 paper on
image metrics if you haven't purchased the Springer-Verlag proceedings yet.

6. Getting papers into Siggraph

Henrik Wann Jensen of Denmark asked about the lack of papers covering
global illumination this year at Siggraph, and if this was a trend or what?
Holly answered that there's a bias against incremental work in any field,
and that Siggraph tends to accept papers that are new directions rather
than the logical next step in a technique previously published.  Ian Ashdown
of Ledalite said that he had submitted something that reviewers liked except
that it didn't have any pretty pictures and was therefore rejected.  (No one
had anything to say to console him on this.)  I made the unsubstantiated claim
that it can help to provide evidence of a real-life application along with
an incremental improvement in one or more existing algorithms, and Holly
agreed that there must be a balance between application and innovation.

There is a lot of useful information by the way on next year's Siggraph
in New Orleans, and even an early opportunity to suggest new ideas by
October 4th.  Look for the "new" icons on the web site:

	http://www.s95.siggraph.org/conferences/siggraph96/siggraph96.html

In particular, you should be aware of the new electronic abstract requirement
for technical papers.

7. Oracle-assisted rendering

Another trend that people discussed (me for one) was the use of oracles
to decide when and where to apply which alogrithms (a.k.a. "hacks") to
improve the speed and quality of renderings.  Some information may be
derived from the scene itself, but other assistance will always require
the user to help the program to guide the calculation.  This is not as
bad as it sounds, since users are after all necessary to rendering, so they
may as well guide it.  I directed people to my EGRW '95 paper on the subject,
which I can make available online if people are interested.  Although I
don't plan to pursue this too much myself, I think it continues to be an
interesting and promising direction for investigation.

8. Rendering code available

Philipp Slusallek of Erlangen Univ. mentioned to the group that they have a
renderer that extends Renderman input to include global illumination
calculations (physically-based) and that code is available from him.
His address is <slusallek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> if you're interested.
(He's going to hate me when he gets back.)

Remember also about the Blue Moon Ray Tracer, written by Larry Gritz
<gritz@seas.gwu.edu> and available at:

	http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html

It also does some global illumination calculations, though I'm not in a
position to compare the two.

As long as I'm plugging other people's code, must mention my own for those
of you who have been asleep or locked up for some time:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/HOME.html


Well, that's about it I guess.  Anyone else who was there and remembers
stuff I forgot or points I left out, please pipe in.  I tend to do a
really bad job at these sorts of summaries, and I neglected to take notes
during the meeting, so I'm relying here on my less-than-adequate memory.

Last week at SigGraph I mentioned that the Cinematography literature
is replete with information concerning real-time global illumination.

Here are a couple of my favorite references:

American Cinematographer Manual 
    Published by the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC), this
    is the Foley, vanDam (F&H) of all cameramen and lighting experts. 
    Complete descriptions of all types of cameras, lights, lenses, 
    filters and supports are given along with comparason tables. 
    Techniques for special visual effects (background plates, compositing,
    miniatures, travelling mattes, optical printers), and special
    techniques (arial, underwater, arctic, tropical, day for night, 
    stereo 3D, sound, television) are briefly discusses. There's even
    a section on Computer Graphics. This is a small book that can be
    found in many good book stores and sells for about $70. 
    ISBN 0-935578-11-0

Millerson, Gerald; "Lighting for Television and Film"; 3rd Ed.; Focal Press;
    This is a very good introduction on how to light for film and
    video. Excellent discussions of the aesthetic qualities of light
    and perception. The basic principals of lighting (key, fill, shadows,
    balance, direction, continuity) are summarized. Detailed chapters
    on lighting people, the production process, atmospheric lighting,
    light sources and equipment, color temperature, picture control,
    scenery, and visual effects. A great book to learn how to light a
    scene to achieve a specific mood. First published in '72, third
    edition revised in '91.
    ISBN 0-240-51299-5

Malkiewicz, Kris; "Cinematography"; Simon & Schuster; '73 & '89
    A shorter, but thorough treatment of the basic techniques. Chapters
    include Cameras, Films and Sensitometry, Filters and Light, Picture
    Quality Control, Sound Recording, Cutting and Lab Work, The Basics
    of Optical Printing, Vehicle and Underwater Cinematography, Production,
    and Video Transfer.
    ISBN 0-671-76220-6

Other excellent texts include:

Lowell, Ross; "Matters of Light & Depth"; Broad Street Books; '92
    ISBN 1-879174-03-0

Brown, Braun & Grondin; "Lighting Secrets for the Professional Photographer";
    Writers Digest Books; '90; ISBN 0-89879-412-9

Hart, John; "Lighting for Action"; AMPHOTO; '92; ISBN 0-8174-4225-1


These contain other references, and I will happily send you more if
you send me mail. I think I might like the third one because the author
makes special mention of Haskell Wexler, who is, of course, not related
to me in any way I know of. I am indebted to Jean Cunningham, one of
our local lighting experts for most of these references.
 
I cannot emphasize enough how much there is to learn from this body
of knowledge. Good lighting with a bad renderer always looks better
than bad lighting with a good renderer, IMHO.

Please note the change of http address for the globillum list's
home page: the new address is

	http://safran.imag.fr/Membres/Francois.Sillion/GlobillumList.html

The reason for the change is that there is now a 'public' page
for access to the world, with the old name (since it had been
diffused through graphics-related archives already). The difference
between the two is mainly access to the main mail alias and
discussion archives. The new setup should prevent glitches such
as uninformed people sending requests to the entire list..

Dear Globillumers,

I'd like to announce the initial release of the radiosity code developed in
our research group (see
http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/cwis/research/graphics/graphics-E.shtml).
 
Features:
---------

- It does both shooting (progressive refinement radiosity) and
  gathering.
- Hierarchical refinement if you like (for both shooting or gathering)
- Importance-driven if you like (for both shooting or gathering)
- Formfactor computation by numerical integration. The ray-casting
  for visibility determination is accelerated by using hierarchical bounding
  boxes, shadow caching and shaftculling.
- handles both triangles and (convex) quadrilaterals.
- T-vertex elimination and many other rendering options.
- reads Greg Wards MGF scene description files (see 
  http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html)
- a more or less nice user interface and interactive view manipulation.
- ...

It requires 
- Motif, 
- Silicon Graphics' Iris GL (or a clone) or PEX  
- an ANSI-C compiler (gcc 2.7.0 was used to develop it) and GNU make (or 
  another make which offers the .include feature, unless you change 
  the Makefiles a bit) to compile it.

You can obtain this code for free on URL:

To: globillum@imag.fr
Date: Thu, 2 Nov 1995 18:24:04 +0200 (MESZ)
Status: R

Hi,
Im writing a .3DS -> .NFF converter for GX/GENERIC and got a problem
w/ the NFF-coefficients for materials : 
A correct conversion of material coefficients from .3DS -> NFF is not possible,
because the diffuse and specular component of object-material in NFF are 
*uniformly* scaled to Red,Green,Blue. e.g.:

## in 3DS: 
MatProperies {    
	RGB Ambient;
    	RGB Diffuse;
    	RGB Specular;
	...
} 

## in NFF:
MatProperties {
        RGB Color; 
        float kDiffuse;   
        float kSpecular;       
	...
}
Thus, for NFF,
   Ambient = 0 , Diffuse = Color * kDiffuse, Specular = Color * kSpecular

My question is: which approximation should be used to convert the 3 vectors
Ambient, Diffuse and Specular in 3DS to the 1 vector Color and the 2
coefficients kDiffuse and kSpecular in NFF ????

 

Thanks in advance,

JuHu

Hello Everyone,

Hi JuHu,

The common approximation used converts color to scaled luminance, and is:

        grey = 0.3*red + 0.59*green + 0.11*blue

This is based on a sort of generic definition of RGB, since there is no
accepted standard for it.

-Greg
------------

By the way, it seems like an appropriate time to make another plug for the
Materials and Geometry Format, which I developed with a little help from my
friends for representing and sharing physically-based scene descriptions
for Monte Carlo rendering, radiosity and similar abuses.  The web site is:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html

While you are there, be sure to check out the conference room model done
by Holly Rushmeier and others at NIST, who also took photometric images
of the actual space for the ultimate comparison.  We also have many cool
and useful scenes and objects, culled from the Radiance distribution and
even a few hand-built examples, including a complete office space with
ugly Dilbert-style cubicle workstations.

Parsing MGF is easy, thanks to the generic ANSI-C parser included, with
more documentation than you can shake a stick at.  All here, all now, all
free.  (Now, you just need some free time to go with it.)

Cool! I never hear about this mind-opened formular. Thanx! 
As far as i undertand, this formula can be used to get kDiffuse and 
kSpecular. But how to do i get Color ? Eric's idea is :
>
>My educated guess would be use the Diffuse color in 3DS, set kD to 1.0, and

I have tested his idea and got better results than my first approximation.

Oops! Sorry to disagree here, Greg, but this approximation is out of date.
I made this same boo-boo in my book, and got firmly (and rightfully)
slapped for it by someone from the University of Manchester. It happens
to be that the < 0.30, 0.59, 0.11 > coefficients were established in the
early days of NTSC color television. As noted by Charles Poynton in his
excellent color FAQ (http://www.inforamp.net/~poynton):

  The coefficients 0.299, 0.587 and 0.114 properly computed luminance
  for monitors having phosphors that were contemporary at the introduction
  of NTSC television in 1953. They are still appropriate for computing
  video *luma* to be discussed below in Section 11 [i.e., Poynton's FAQ].
  However, these coefficients do not accurately compute luminance for
  contemporary monitors.

Backing up a few paragraphs:

  Contemporary CRT phosphors are standardardized in ITU-R Recommendation
  BT.709, "Basic Parameter Values for the HDTV Standard for the Studio
  and for the International Programme Exchange (1990) [formerly CCIR
  Rec. 709], to be described in Section 17 (ibid). The weights to
  compute true CIE luminance from *linear* red, green and blue (indicated
  without prime symbols), for the Rec. 709, are these:

    y709 = 0.2125 R + 0.7154 G + 0.0721 B

So, there you have it. These coefficients are roughly the same as the
old NTSC coefficients. However, the differences are quite evident in
the resultant gray-scale images, particularly for saturated colors.

Thanks for the correction.  Actually, I never use the coefficients I
quoted myself, but I didn't have any authority on anything else.  The
fact remains that there is no accepted standard for RGB color space.
The values I use myself come from some averaging of computer monitor
primaries undertaken by Gary Meyer, and are:

	grey = .265*red + .670*green + .065*blue

Are HDTV primaries the same as typical computer monitors?  Anyway, it's
all moot if you ask me, and could form the basis of an endless argument.

I still need to sign myself up for IES membership, so I can vote in
the February meeting....

As I told Ian, I don't use this formula myself.  I just parroted it because
it's the only one I've seen repeatedly and I didn't want to go sticking my
neck out with a different set of RGB primaries.  The ones I use were from
an average set of measurements done by Gary Meyer, a generally reliable
source.  The resulting coefficients are:

	grey = 0.265*red + 0.670*green + 0.065*blue

This isn't exactly what Ian recommended, but it's close.  I don't know about
anti-aliasing applications for it -- what do you mean, exactly?

=======================================================================

[ANNOUNCE] A Generic 3D Graphics Kernel V1.3

Current graphic systems (traditional or object-oriented) offer a
certain amount of functionality but also prescribe a lot of impli-
cations, constraints and may not fit a given task. The result is
that in many cases people start from scratch, implement the basic
graphics stuff again and again.

The objective of the announced project is to develop a generic 3D
graphics kernel that may be used to implement an own system by 
derivating the generic one. By aggregation and inheritance the 
interfaces and implementation of the generic kernel may be used. 
The generic kernel shall offer a huge functionality consisting of 
uncoupled classes that may adaptively be integrated into a specialized
system without any run-time and memory overhead.

The principal functionality of the system will be [is]:
- basic parametric aggregates and related operators
  [parametric fix-sized vector, dl list, dynamic list, for-each iterators]
- elementary graphical data types: vector (2D, 3D, generic), matrices,
  colors, vertex, etc. and related operators
  [2D, 3D, nD Vector, 4x4, nxn Matrix, "Phong" Surface, RGB color, different vertex types]
- essential scene collections (DAG, tree, binary tree, linear list)
  [based on above-mentioned aggregates]
- basic graphical design patterns such as PHIGS' CSS, or a CGRM 
  environment with its components
- basic topological classes w/ covariant extensibility 
  [1D-, 2D-, Polyhedron topology, parametric curve and surface] 
- abstract and concrete rendering classes (rendering interfaces,
  camera models, specific rendering primitives, i.e., Quadric for
  ray-tracing)
  [ray-tracing and shading interface, perspectivic and orthographic
  camera model, shader, ray-tracer, quadric, polygon, shading and 
  ray-tracing iterators to be used for cameras and composites, to
  be platform-independent, the specific shading stuff is encapsulated
  in a "device driver" with following realizations until now:
	* OpenGL and X11
	* OpenGL and Tk 3.6/4.0
	* OpenGL and Windows/NT 
	* OpenGL and Windows/NT and Tk3.6
	* OpenGL and Windows/NT and MFC 2.0
  NOTE: OpenGL compatible public domain library Mesa has been
  tested successfully as replacement for OpenGL]
- pixel-based output devices [Pixmap, ImageFile]
- rendering-independent mathematical stuff, e.g., Splines and free
  form surfaces [solid textures, bump mappings, interpolated spline curves and surfaces]
- basic interaction classes (abstract and concrete, e.g., low-level
  event types) [2D mouse and spaceball events, socket encapsulation, 
  pixmap update event, callbacks, abstract input device featuring 
  feedback access and hierarchical organization, input server,
  timer and file input devices] 	
- utility classes (identification, file formats, user interface 
  integration) [string, SGI-, Targa-, RGBA-file format, Tcl language
  binding (optional), interpretative class system, generic DeltaBlue
  constraint solver]

For papers discussing the need for a generic graphics kernel see
ftp://metallica.prakinf.tu-ilmenau.de/pub/PROJECTS/GENERIC/dublin.ps.gz
ftp://metallica.prakinf.tu-ilmenau.de/pub/PROJECTS/GENERIC/springer95.ps.gz

The generic kernel itself is available by
ftp://metallica.prakinf.tu-ilmenau.de/pub/PROJECTS/GENERIC/generic1.3.tar.gz

The generic kernel is provided with all sources and may be used for
both commercial and non-commercial projects without restrictions.
Comments, discussion and extensions are greatly welcome.

Derived kernels until now:
  GX - an extended ray-tracing kernel by Nguyen Duc Cuong
  GT - an NFF compatible ray-tracing kernel for test purposes 
       basing on GX (GX and GT are parts of the distribution) 
  EGR GF - an object-oriented commercial semantic kernel for European 
       furniture industry (headers included for demonstration purposes)
  EGR MAF - a distributed Multimedia application framework 
  EGR TIGER - an interpretative OpenGL environment including Motif-like GUI
       functionality and hi-level OpenGL-based kernel for education

Kernels in work:
  GY - reimplementation of former 3D graphics kernel YART
  GP - sample implementation of ISO PREMO

Hi everyone -

I did look up the cow paper once, and it is for real.
The motivation was designing heating systems for
the care of livestock.

Here is a summary:

"Uses mechanical integrator to measure factors from various
wall elements to a cow, and presents some results for size
of equivalent sphere that gives same factor as cow. It is
found that the sphere origin should be place at one-fourth of
the withers-to-pin-bone length back of the withers, at a height
above the floor of two-thirds the height of the withers, and the
equivalent sphere radius should be 1.8, 2.08 or 1.78 times the
heart girth for exchange with the floor and ceiling,
sidewalls, or front and back walls respectively. Also
discusses exchange between cows and entire bounding walls,
floor and ceiling and between parallel cows."

I don't think I kept a copy of the paper, so please don't ask me for it.
As I recall, the authors were from California, and the paper
was initially read at an agricultural meeting held at Cornell.
I looked it up in the library at Ga. Tech., but I expect
it could be found at other places, such as Cornell (in Mann
library if Carpenter doesn't have it) which
has a degree program in Agricultural Engineering.

Pastorally,
Holly

Hi,
I am going to implement the "ray-classification" methode in GX for completeness 
(GX does BSP and ABVH, but not any of the 3 directional techniques: 
light-buffer, ray-coherence and  ray-classification). 

I have some questions about the construction of the 5D-hyper-octree :
 
 1. Should i map the enviroment (the box, which contains  finite objects 
    and the eye) to the unit-cube ? If yes, which methode is the best way 
    to do it ? 
 2. How do i construct a beam ? As J.Arvo and D.Kirk suggested, one can use
    cone-beams and bounding spheres for speedup, but i'm confused about the
    construction of a cone-beam from a 3D-voxel and a 2D-UV-cell. Is this the
    cone w/ 2 end-points at the centers of 2 bounding-spheres of the voxel and
    the UV-cell ?
 3. I think, the BSP-Tree could be precomputed, and only the 6 2D-faces must be
    subdivide on the fly. This is faster for animations w/ static scene and 
    a flying-camera. Spatial subdivision is less view-dependent than
    directional-subdivision, is'n it ?   

Thanks for any help.

Hello there,
		I wonder could anyone give me information on Radiosity.
I would like information on where to get code to implement the radiosity
algorithm eg ftp sites.My project entails solving the radiosity equation for
a cubical room with a light source at the centre of the roof and a cube at the 
centre of the floor.I am using ray-tracing for form factor evaluation and 
for the final viewing phase.I am using progresive refinement to solve the     
equation itself.I wonder could anyone give me some information as to where 
to find code or anything else helpfull for this problem.

Sounds like you want Ian Ashdown's book:

Ashdown, I. 1994. Radiosity: A Programmer's Perspective. New York, NY:
John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Softcover, 498 pages, 12 color plates.

ISBN 0-471-30444-1 (without diskette)                $44.95 US
ISBN 0-471-30488-3 (with 3.5-inch MS-DOS diskette)   $59.95 US

A demo version of his radiosity implementation, called HELIOS, is available
from the Ledalite web site:

	http://www.ledalite.com/

He has also written a nice IES luminaire file parser, which I recommend to
anyone who is serious about realistic rendering, available from the same
site.

If you want some good, physically-based models and solutions to compare to,
also check out the following site, which I manage:

which nomenclature should i use ? heat transfer or global
illumination (proposed standard, or ANSI/IES RP-16-1986) ?

i am torn between using nomenclature from siegel's & howell's book 
"thermal radiation heat transfer" (which i think is a standard work on 
radiative heat transfer), global illumination literature, and the 
proposed standard for global illumination. 

any recommendations ?

This summarizes recommended notation from ANSI/IES RP-16-1986, which is
the preferred standard for global illumination.  Even if you are working
within the field of radiative heat transfer, this is a more consistent
notation for a broader audience.  (Someone, correct me if I'm mistaken.)

Hi,
Is there any general (not only polygonal) approach to compute the shadow 
boundaries for volume-lightsoures ? I use Monte-Carlo-technique to compute
softshadows and got many problems w/ it. Even with importance sampling, the
raytracer requires a lot of shadow-rays to fire to produce an acceptable
image. There are too much noises, and some small occluding patches are
missed. An analytical solution would be nice, but i only found papers
where special solutions for polygonal objects are described. Is it possible
to contruct the discontinuity mesh for all types of objects ?

Thanks for any help.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Free Radiosity Renderer (inc. C++ source code)
Date: 	Sat, 17 Feb 1996 10:27:55 -0800
Status: R

Hi, folks. My apologies for cluttering up your mailbox, but
rumour has it that some of you (or, more likely, your undergrad
students) are actually using the HELIOS radiosity renderer from
my book. The following is a self-serving blurb announcing that
the complete (and guaranteed 100% free) C++ development package
for HELIOS V1.02C is now available for downloading from our Web
server.

- Ian Ashdown

----------------------------------------------------------------

The C++ source code for HELIOS, a fully-functional radiosity
renderer for MS-Windows 3.1, is now available for downloading
on the 'net ...

"Radiosity" is a computer graphics technique that enables you to 
synthesize photorealistic images. Whereas ray tracing techniques 
excel in the rendition of point light sources, specular 
reflections, and refraction effects, radiosity methods accurately 
model area light sources, diffuse reflections, color bleeding 
between surfaces, and detailed shading within shadows. They are 
in a sense complementary approaches to photorealistic rendering. 

Folklore had it that you needed a graphics workstation with 
gigabytes of RAM or even a supercomputer to do radiosity 
rendering. This is no longer true: You can use your personal 
desktop computer -- a '386 IBM-PC with a math coprocessor, 4 MB 
of RAM, and a 256-color SVGA display will do nicely -- to 
experiment with radiosity methods. A 66-MHz '486DX machine will 
render a simple scene (540 polygons) in less than three minutes. 
A more complex scene with 2,700 polygons can be rendered in a 
little over six minutes.

Commercial radiosity renderers are slowly making their way into 
the marketplace. Take a look, for example, at the incomparable 
Lightscape Visualization system (http://www.lightscape.com) to 
see what is available now for Windows NT. (Other interesting 
sites on the Web for commercial radiosity renderers are 
http://www.bentley.com/products/masterpiece.html -- download the 
Microstation MasterPiece Technical Profile -- and the Italian
http://www.atma.it/english/rlight.html.) 

In the meantime, you can download HELIOS to experiment with the 
possibilities of radiosity rendering using MS-Windows 3.1 or 
Windows 95. The Web site is:

  http://www.ledalite.com/lighthouse.html
 
where you will find a demonstration version of HELIOS Version 
1.02C (106 KB) and the complete C++ development package (806 KB), 
including four different executable versions of HELIOS, fully-
commented C++ source code (over 12,700 lines), make files for 
Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5 and Borland C++ 4.5, online help files, 
two demonstration environments, demo images, and more.

(While you are perusing our Web site, you might want to look at
http://www.ledalite.com/library/ledapub.html -- we have an 
eclectic variety of academic papers and articles on computer 
graphics and related topics available online for downloading.)

The HELIOS development package is *not* in the public domain. It 
is copyrighted material that may be freely copied, redistributed, 
and/or modified for personal, non-commercial use ONLY, provided 
the copyright notice is included with all source code files. 

HELIOS was first developed in: 

  Ashdown, I. 1994. Radiosity: A Programmer's Perspective. New 
  York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Softcover, 498 pages, 12 
  color plates. 

  ISBN 0-471-30444-1 (without diskette)                $39.95 US
  ISBN 0-471-30488-3 (with 3.5-inch MS-DOS diskette)   $54.95 US

This book provides a detailed explanation of radiosity theory and 
its associated algorithms (no knowledge of higher mathematics 
required!) More important, it also includes complete, fully 
documented, and compiler-independent C++ source code (over 7,500 
lines) for HELIOS Version 1.00A, a fully-functional radiosity-
based rendering program for MS-Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and 
Windows NT.

The radiosity-related code presented in the book is identical to 
that now offered online. If you want to fully understand how 
HELIOS (and radiosity) works, you more or less need to buy the 
book.

You can order "Radiosity: A Programmer's Perspective" from your 
local bookseller or (in the United States) directly from John 
Wiley & Sons by calling 1-800-CALL-WILEY. You can also order the 
book online from http://www.wiley.com.

Caught in the Shadows
</H1>
<ADDRESS>
by Joey Bruno
</ADDRESS>
<P><B>Even the most stunning 3D models are useless without light sources. Put
these tips, tricks, and hands-on techniques to the test to get the most from
your light sources.
</B></P>
<P>
The notion of lighting a 3D scene seems rather simplistic, but it's not.
Consider the many ways that shadows are created in 3D programs -- from a simple,
single light source to special effect shots with uplighting, whirling
spotlights, and laser bolts flying freely. And these effects are not limited to
the higher-end workstations or software -- 3D packages selling for as little as
$500 offer the ability to create lighting and shadow effects.
</P>
<P>
So what's the big deal? Why all the fuss about lighting a scene and simulating
shadows? Sure you can build some geometry, throw a shadow-casting light source
or two in and render away. But if you think that's all there is to it, think
again. If your goal is to add realism to your design but you neglect to spend
the time setting up the lights within it, you're all but asking for trouble.
When it gets down to the final scene, it won't matter that your geometry is
perfect or that you've included more special effects than a sci-fi movie. If
your lighting and shadows are sloppy, people will notice. 
</P>
<P>
Understand the shadows
</P>
<P>
A shadow is not a hard, razor-edged entity, nor is it an absolute absence of
light. Shadows are created by blocking the in-line flow of light from an object,
which can be caused by refraction, diffusion, or complete blockage. Consider for
a moment how light itself works. Light does not cast a perfectly straight beam
-- it projects in all directions from its source. This scattering effect is
referred to as &quot;propagation.&quot; Rays of light run three-dimensionally in
a radial fashion from their sources. Close to the source, the rays are densely
packed. As they move out, they disperse. That's why the effect of light gets
weaker the further it moves from its source.
</P>
<P>
Consider how propagation affects an object. What do these radial light waves do
when they strike an object? How about when light waves strike light waves or
light waves interact with atmospheric diffusion? The physics get complicated,
but in a nutshell, it produces scatter. When light strikes an object, especially
the face of an object perpendicular to its source, it &quot;kicks&quot; the
light back in the same direction as its source, causing reflections in an
object. The greater an object's ability to return this light without
interference from its surface characteristics (i.e., less returned diffusion),
the shinier it is.
</P>
<P>
Light rays reach a breaking point at the edge of an object. Edges that are
jutting out in space tend to &quot;slice&quot; the beam; part of the beam will
strike the object and other parts of the beam will scatter. This scattering
light must go somewhere. The energy of the light will tend to make it continue
in the direction it was originally traveling. However, it may be a bit
off-course because of a diffusion material (probably atmosphere).
</P>
<P>
The important thing to remember is the energy factor involved. The more energy
the photon of light has, the more it will tend to stay on course after
diffusion. Remember also that light waves are more dense and compact near their
source.
</P>
<P>
Imagine that you have a crate sitting in a large room and a single light source
at the far end of that room. The room should be fairly well lit near the light
and the crate should cast somewhat of a shadow. However, this shadow will
probably be more of a negative highlight effect with a roughly definable outline
of the crate on the floor. Now move the crate closer to the light. The shadow
edge will become more defined as you approach the light. because the photons of
light are stronger, they tend to travel more closely toward their original path
in a straight line. Also, depending on the amount of scattered light in the
room, the shadow will have more depth and contrast to the rest of the scene as
it approaches the light source.
</P>
<P>
Prepare yourself
</P>
<P>
Now, let's talk about 3D models and how to apply some of these techniques to
them. First of all, it is a great temptation to make shadows razor-edged with 3D
software -- besides, it's a neat effect. 3D lighting and objects tend to be &quot;perfect&quot;
in their interaction, which means lights can be absolute, without diffusion or
drop off, and have pure color saturation.
</P>
<P>
Some software packages can help to minimize this temptation by offering
raytraced shadows. Raytracing allows the shadowing effects to behave in a more
natural (light bouncing) fashion. As long as you don't go crazy with lights and
wash everything out, you'll be okay. The problem with creating raytraced shadows
on a PC is that the renderings take so long to produce. For a still shot it's
not a big deal, but incorporating raytrace rendering into an animation (even a
small one) can become a nightmare. Therefore, it's wise to use regular shadows
for animation and reserve raytracing for stills. Besides, animation tends to
minimize any &quot;goofs&quot; you make in setting up your lights and shadows.
</P>
<P>
Whether your software has the ability to create raytraced shadows or not, the
following can help minimize the effects of improperly used lights and shadows:
</P>
<P>
&iuml; Plan your shots and decide where lights and (especially) shadows are
going to play a role. Don't worry about the shadows on &quot;the other side of
that mountain&quot; or &quot;building&quot; unless you're going to be visiting
it at some point.
</P>
<P>
&iuml; Use a variety of lights. Don't make the mistake of using a single,
pinpoint light source as the sun or broad daylight. Use a nice, even, ambient
lighting set-up and place spotlights for shadows on objects that need them. The
exception to this is architectural renderings. These renderings have
traditionally been done a certain way, with hard-edged, single-source lighting.
It's a matter of tradition over accuracy. However, do offer your clients the
choice of both. They might surprise you and break tradition a bit if you can
show them good reason.
</P>
<P>
&iuml; Don't forget about diffusion and remember that light scatters. Go ahead
and let your scene have razor sharp edges in its shadows. Now, go to the
opposite end of the scene and add a contrasting fill light. Bring the level of
the fill light up until you get a nice &quot;washing&quot; effect in the
shadows. This is a very realistic effect if done properly and will give you
results almost identical to raytracing.
</P>
<P>
If your software has the ability to project images with a light source (a movie
projector of sorts) and you can make matte objects (objects that don't render,
yet still affect the scene), try this. Set up all of your lights, then matte out
all the objects in the scene. Render from the top and record all the shadows
where they strike the ground. Take this image into a paint program and apply
some effects to it over time, using the same number of frames that your
animation will have. Now take all the lights out of your scene except for one
big fill light (an omni light works great for this since it creates good
highlights), bring all the objects back so they will render, project your shadow
effect from above and move your fill light around. Depending on what you did in
the paint program and how you move your fill light, you can make shadows &quot;fall&quot;
backwards, which makes all the shadows dissolve into a whirlpool or simply
transform into flowers. It's strange, but can be a very neat effect.
</P>
<P>
And, finally...
</P>
<P>
Read up on how lighting works. Check out some good books on theatrical lighting
from the library or go to a good modeling/hobby shop and pick up a book or two
on photographing model railroads. Some of the techniques in these books are pure
genius and are easily applied to computer generated graphics.
</P>
<P>
Or turn to film for inspiration. Watch some old black and white movies or look
at some old photos or stills. Movie makers of the past didn't have the luxury of
color to give their scenes depth or definition. Take another look at cinema
classics like <I>Citizen Kane</I> or <I>Gaslight</I> to see how shadows become
a part of the storyline. Make note of the contrasts created using lights and
shadows and take the techniques of yesteryear to work with you today.

Hi --
I'm sorry to send this to such a large list, but since
I correspond with a lot of you periodically I thought
this would be the most efficient way to reach people
who might be sending me papers to review,
requests for information, etc.

I have decided to leave NIST and take a position at IBM
Watson Research center. My last day at NIST will be March 26.
I will be in at work only a couple of days a week between then and now
before starting work April 1 at Watson. I don't have any address info.
for up there yet.

Has anyone else out there implemented wavelet radiosity using triangular

number of different ways to approach the various parts of the problem, and
it would be interesting to compare our approach with any others that exist.

You can get a postscript copy of the first off my web page or George's.
Start from, for example, http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/elf/elf.html
and poke around in my "papers" page.  I think it goes out to George's

As for the second, I can't seem to find the troff source for it.  Hmmm.
Maybe Alain has it.  I know a real paper copy is sitting in a pile somewhere

Dear Globillumers,

It is my pleasure to announce that my PhD dissertation is now available
on the net. The dissertation is entitled:

	Mathematical Models and Monte Carlo Algorithms
		for Physically Based Rendering

It's all about global illumination models, Monte Carlo methods, variance
reduction techniques, path tracing, light tracing and bidirectional path
tracing. You can find the abstract, an overview of the chapters, the
table of contents, the colour images and the dissertation itself at:

Ok, we often pretend that we are solving for radiance, or
spectral radiance at each pixel.  But chances are we are
calculatining luminance Y = 683 lm/cd INT y(lambda) L(lambda) dlamba
as well as X and Z.  In a "radiosity" program (no flames please)
we calculate luminous exitance plus some X and Z that are like
luminous exitance but with x and z for weighting functions.

Here is the question, if Y is called luminance, what are
X and Z called?  And what is (X,Y,Z) called?  And if V is
scotopic luminance, what is (V,X,Y,Z) called?

The IES handbook and W&S do not seem to have an answer (but
one can miss a 20 page article in either of those volumes!).
Does anyone?

Thanks,

Pete

PS-- Bruce Walter suggested "tristimulance" for (X,Y,Z), and
this also implies "tristimulous exitance".
I am not sure what (V,X,Y,Z) is in this system.

Thanks to Juhana and to Sumant.

So, does this dissertation present the ultimate solution to the global

  Hi Globillumers !  
My PhD thesis is now available. It deals with hierarchical radiosity,
radiosity derivatives, namely first derivatives (Jacobian or gradient)
and second derivatives (Hessian), and how to compute them (especially
the Hessian). 

It also explores ways to use these derivatives to compute reliable
error-bounds on any interaction, using concavity properties of the
radiosity. Finally, it presents a refinement strategy based on these
error bounds.

The thesis is on A4 paper, takes 176 pages:
ftp://ftp.imag.fr/pub/Mediatheque.IMAG/theses/96-Holzschuch.Nicolas/these.ps.gz
(3.4 Mo)
If you wish, there is a version with 2 pages on one, takes only 88
pages: 
ftp://ftp.imag.fr/pub/Mediatheque.IMAG/theses/96-Holzschuch.Nicolas/these.a5.ps.gz
(3.4 Mo anyway)

I'm afraid it is written in french. There should be a paper in english
dealing with the same problems, coming real soon :-)

Abstract
=======
We introduce several improvements to the hierarchical radiosity 
method.  First, a complete analysis of a specific implementation of 
the hierarchical radiosity method allows to point out its bottlenecks.  
Based on this analysis, we suggest two simple improvements: a lazy 
evaluation of top-level interactions, and a new refinement criterion, 
that greatly reduces the number of interactions, without loss of 
precision.  A brief introduction to the properties of functions of 
several variables and their derivatives follows, which allows a 
rewriting of the expression of radiosity, and hence a better numerical 
approximation.  Methods for the estimation of the error produced 
during the radiosity computations are analysed.  We then introduce the 
concavity properties of the radiosity function that, combined with an 
exact computation of the radiosity derivatives, allow a complete 
control of the error on the interactions between patches, and hence a 
precise minoration and majoration of the radiosity on all the patches.  
We introduce a new refinement criterion based on this modelling of 
interactions, and a complete hierarchical radiosity algorithm using 
this refinement criterion.  The last part of the thesis is devoted to 
practical computations of the radiosity derivatives (gradient and 
Hessian), first for a constant emitter with total visibility, then for 
a constant emitter with partial visibility and for an emitter with 
linear radiosity.

dear global illumination researchers and others,

charged by, and under the leadership of, bernard chazelle,
the CG Impact Task Force has completed its report entitled
"Application Challenges to Computational Geometry."  it's an
exhortation to comp. geometers to get more involved in identi-
fying and attacking problems faced by practitioners in many
areas of geometric computing, including computer graphics,
imaging, shape reconstruction, machine vision, GIS, mesh
generation, robotics, manufacturing, robustness, computa-
tional and molecular biology, and astrophysics.

i hope that many in our community will find it an interesting,
provocative read as well.

three versions (dvi, postscript, and compressed postscript)
of the full report are available at

Opportunities at LightWork Design

LightWork Design is Europe's leading 3D computer graphics software
developer.
We specialise in the fields
of 3D graphical technologies for modelling, rendering, simulation 
and animation.
Since our formation in 1989, we have experienced substantial 
year on year growth and expect this to continue.
We recruit software engineers on an on-going basis and our looking 
for high calibre graduates with commercial experience.
Details of current specific vacancies are given below.


About LightWork Design

Lightwork was founded by four people in 1989 and has grown to a staff 
of 25 today (May 1996) with a target of 40 by 1997.

The majority of our staff are young software engineers engaged in the 
design, implementation, testing and support of products and bespoke
software development in the areas of 3D graphical technologies.

Products that we develop, market and support directly are LightWorks
and LightWorks-NC.
These are component technologies: toolkit products that are licensed
to other software development companies who embed them within their
own products and sell on the technologies to end users.
LightWorks provides a wide range of photo-realistic rendering capabilities
and LightWorks-NC is a simulation and verification tool for Numerical
Control processes.
Both products are supported on a very broad range of computing platforms,
including PCs running Windows 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows NT, Unix
workstations from Sun, Silicon Graphics, Hewlett Packard, IBM and DEC, 
and Macintosh computers.

We also develop a number of plug-in modules for other products
that are marketed through other channels, including those for SolidWorks, 
Autodesk's 3D Studio MAX, Apple's QuickDraw-3D and Ricoh's DESIGNBASE.


Our customers

Having already established ourselves as one of the world's 
leading suppliers of graphics technology for CAD/CAM, our business is 
now expanding into the mainstream 3D graphics and animation markets. 

We currently have over 50 customers and partners in the industry
including Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, Autodesk, EDS/Unigraphics, 
Auto-des-sys, Engineering Animation, Matra Datavision, Ricoh Corporation 
and Integrated Computing Engines.

We are working with a number of significant players in the graphics
and animation and internet industries and expect new products
towards the end of 1996.


What we expect from you

We expect candidates of the highest calibre.
All our software engineers have a BSc in a science or engineering 
discipline, with many having MSc or PhD degrees.
The work we do is intellectually demanding, and requires excellent 
analytical skills.
We require individuals who are perceptive, dedicated, creative and 
eager to succeed, and who want to be among the very best in their field.

We are looking for team players; those who thrive in a vibrant
environment of young and energetic individuals with drive and a passion for
computer graphics technology.

We pride ourselves on the quality and robustness of our software.
We expect high standards of software engineering, with close attention
to detail, and a focus on developing bug-free software.  You will
need to be a competent programmer in C or C++, and familiar with
developing software on a Unix, Windows or Macintosh platform.

We expect you to be creative and to contribute ideas from day one.
You will need to communicate your ideas effectively to colleagues 
and customers.

You may be required to travel internationally to visit our customers
and partners; the majority of our revenues are earned in the USA,
Europe and Japan.


What you can expect from LightWork

You can expect that your hard work will be recognised and that 
you will be rewarded according to your contribution.
We offer competitive salaries and a package that includes
non-contributory pension, a minimum of four weeks paid holiday per year,
and a profit-sharing scheme.

We want to continue to expand, and need candidates who are eager to 
take on new challenges, including technical project leadership.
Expect to be pushed to the limits of your capabilities, and to
move quickly into a position of responsibility.

Subject: Jarek Rossignac to Head GVU Center at Georgia Tech

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


May 22, 1996


Jarek Rossignac to become the new Director of Georgia Tech's top-ranked
Graphics, Visualization & Usability (GVU) Center


The Georgia Institute of Technology's College of Computing has invited
Jarek Rossignac to head its Graphics, Visualization & Usability (GVU)
Center. It is anticipated that Dr. Rossignac, who succeeds Dr. James D.
Foley, will assume his duties on August 1, 1996. He will report to Dean
Peter Freeman and will be a professor in the College of Computing.

An internationally known researcher, Dr. Rossignac comes to GVU from IBM's
T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY, where he is the Senior
Manager of Visualization, Interaction and Graphics, leading research
activities in interactive 3D graphics, scientific and medical
visualization, and industrial applications of virtual reality. He was the
Research Strategist for Visualization and was also responsible for the
development of two IBM visualization and walkthrough products. He holds a
PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Rochester, NY, and a
Diplome d'Ingenieur in Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering
from the ENSEM, Nancy, France. His most notable scientific contributions
are in solid modeling and animation, compression and interactive rendering
of highly complex 3D databases, and user interfaces for 3D design and
navigation. He has chaired several international conference committees,
regularly serves as associate or guest editor for professional journals,
has authored 13 patents and more than 40 papers, and has won numerous
awards for his publications and technical contributions

"Dr. Rossignac has not only shown his creativity in his personal research,
but he has been an effective leader in building a strong research group at
IBM," said Peter Freeman, Dean of the College of Computing. "We selected
him from among the very few candidates who have the creativity, experience
and energy required to lead GVU into the next century. We are extremely
pleased to have him."

Established at Georgia Tech in 1991 and housed in the College of Computing,
the GVU Center is an interdisciplinary research center comprised of faculty
and graduate students from nine diverse campus units including Computing;
Architecture; Psychology; Industrial & Systems Engineering; and Literature,
Communication & Culture. The Center encourages collaborative research and
innovative approaches in applying new technologies to everyday problems. In
March of this year, the GVU Center was ranked #1 in the country in
'Graphics: User Interaction' in a survey of doctoral programs conducted by
U.S. News & World Report.

Dr. Rossignac believes that GVU's size, diversity and unique combination of
talents make it the perfect breeding ground for fundamental innovations in
the way we communicate with computers and, more importantly, the way we use
computers to do our work faster and better communicate with each other.

Dr. Foley, GVU's founding director, will leave Georgia Tech this summer to
become Director of the Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab in Cambridge, MA,
and Executive Vice President of Mitsubishi Electric Information Technology
Center America. He will maintain his ties to Georgia Tech as a member of
the College of Computing's Advisory Board. Dr. Foley said of Dr.
Rossignac's appointment, "We have attracted a dynamic leader and respected
researcher who will not only maintain but further strengthen our research
and educational programs. I expect to see the GVU Center continue in a
leadership position for many years."

After August 1, 1996, Dr. Rossignac can be reached as follows:

Here's a great little anecdote that illustrates just how far
rendering is from reality:

One of our animators was trying to simulate a shadow using
a projection light. He created a texture that was white where
he wanted light, and black where he wanted shadow. Then he
used a special material shader we have called a 'shadow-only'
shader that renders the inverse shadow (ie. white/gray wherever
there are shadows and black everywhere else). As you might
guess, the "shadows" from the projection light did not show
up in the image generated by the shadow-only shader. 

When I explained the situation to him I caught myself saying:

"Well, those points are not in shadow. They are illuminated
with black light."

He looked at me with a completely blank expression, so I went on:

"If you were in a completely closed room without a light,
would the room be completely shadowed, or not illuminated?"

The boundary between science and philosophy is a blurry one.

Of course we aren't always trying to duplicate reality.  Sometimes,
especially in scientific visualization, we want to make realistic
*seeming* images of things that one can not see.  My anecdote
on the communication break down between disciplines goes like this...

A petroleum engineer (old, gruff and crotchety) was attending the
annual project review for the Visualization group at an oil company
research lab.  The company and the engineer shall remain nameless, but
one of the people making the presentation was my friend, collaborator
and one time student, Mark Lee.  The main uses of visualization in the
oil company were in the analysis of seismic data and the display of
petroleum reservoir simulation results.  Mark was explaining about
adding capabilities to use a variety of shading models, and what the
input to the vis package needed to be for some of the nicer shaders.
In particular, he described the benefits of being able to specify the
position of the light source, and change it interactively, in
enhancing visibility of certain things in the visualization.

The petroleum engineer interrupts and rather rudely proclaims to all
that the software can't POSSIBLY work like that 'cause everybody knows
there's no light underground.  Mark tried to explain, but his critic
couldn't pry his mind open enough to understand the explanation.

In my very humble opinion, the definitive bible on global illumination has yet
to be written. One good reason for this is that global illumination research is
still a very active topic. There have been close to 100 global illumination
papers and theses released in the past six months alone. Given that it takes
12 to 18 months to get a book written and published, any "bible" will be at
least a year out of date as soon as it is released.

Knowing how much one publisher in particular marks up its books for the UK
market, I shudder to think how much the two-volume set will cost you. You may
have to give up beer for the remainder of your academic career :+)

For what it's worth, I much prefer Glassner to Foley et alia as my primary CG
reference. However, I can appreciate that many undergraduate students may be
intimidated by the mathematical depth of the former. Different strokes ...

This was Arjan's PhD thesis at the Delft University of Technology.

There have been at least two other books written on radiosity, but neither
qualify as global illumination "bibles."

Actually, the best sources of up-to-date and comprehensive information on global
illumination techniques are the most recent MSc and PhD theses, many of
which are

required to demonstrate their in-depth knowledge of the field, which generally
means a 50-page prologue to their actual research topic, and a bibliography with

Subject: Report on Dagstuhl and Porto rendering conferences.
Status: R

The following is a report on three conferences I attended. I am broadcasting it
because it contains summaries of several papers that may not appear for a while
in more widely read venues. I appologize if your paper was not mentioned. Only
the first two conferences were on rendering, so you might want to skip the
stuff about the last one, though my summaries for it are mostly restricted to
rendering-related talks.

   My first stop was the University of Kaiserslautern, where I visited the
research laboratory of Hans Hagen. Hans arranged for a schedule of
demonstrations and discussions with his graduate students, and arranged for
them to take me out to lunch and dinner in town (I paid for my food, but they
provided the transportation and the company, which was a nice form of
hospitality.) I was impressed with Hans' personal research in the design of
plastic reflector and lens shapes for car headlights, to give a desired
distribution of illumination intensity on the road. I also had a long
discussion with Alexander Keller, who explained to me in detail the
Quasi-Monte-Carlo method he was using for global illumination, which he
presented at both of the next two meetings. He gave me the longer"uncut"
version of his paper, so I was able to appreciate well the fact that certain
non-random sequences of test points give estimates that converge much faster
than for random test points. A final memorable project was a method where
potential purchasers could design and view semi-custom prefabricated homes over
the Internet.

   The meeting in Schloss Dagstuhl was one of a series of week-long seminars in
aspects of Computer Science partially supported by the governments of Germany
and the state of Saarbrucken. The topic of this seminar was rendering, and it
was scheduled to just precede the Eurographics workshop the following week. The
hope was that attendees from outside Europe would gain efficiency in their long
distance travel plans, which was the case for me, but many Europeans could
not afford more than a week away from their institutions, especially if they
were teaching, so the attendance at the Eurographics Workshop was actually down
from last year. A summary of the some of talks follows.

   Xavier Pueyo proposed methods for generating random densities of infinite
lines in space, and intersecting each line with all objects in the scene to get
form factor contributions from each segment in the space between two object
surfaces. He chose his lines by connecting two random points on the surface of
a sphere enclosing all the objects, and I later pointed out that this will not
give the correct density because it is missing a cosine term.
Dani Tost discussed her work on visualizing blood vessels, involving both
maximum intensity projection and shading, with voxel splats.

   Henrick Wann Jensen's talk on "Global Illumination using Photon Maps"
generated the most excitement and discussion of the seminar, because of the
impressive performance of his method, which is based on saving in a spatial
data structure (a KD tree) both position and direction of all hits by photon
paths traced from light sources through multiple random bounces. During
viewpoint dependent rendering, these are used for the intensity at the second
bounce in a local pass from the eye, by expanding a sphere about the hit point
until the n closest photon hits are found in the KD tree. At the first bounce
from the eye, the same distribution is used for importance sampling of the
bounced rays. Finally, the initial rays from the light source are continued
past their first surface intersection to create shadow maps at subsequent
intersections, which are used to decide when shadow feelers are necessary to
determine direct illumination. Since the incoming directions are available, non
diffuse reflections can be rendered. A separate caustic map, with many more
photons directed at only the shiny surfaces, is used similarly at the first
bounce in rendering.

   Dani Lischinski gave a preview of a Siggraph paper on "Hierarchical Image
Caching for Accelerated Walkthroughs of Complex Environments." Robert Garmann
talked on the computational complexity of hierarchical radiosity, and gave a
careful analysis of the number of links required in a simple scene with two
parallel plane patches, in which the subdivision oracle is based on the total
form factor of a link. He showed that the total number of links, as the allowed
error approaches zero, is of order O(N^2), where N is the number of leaf nodes
in the hierarchical subdivision. This seems to contradict previous beliefs that
it would be O(N log N), or even O(N).

   Dieter Fellner, working with Stefan M|ller's group at Darmstadt, showed how
real time rendering of radiosity scenes could be accomplished on environments
with the order of a million polygons, and presented an impressive video of
additions to the Frankfort airport.

   Wolfgang St|rzlinger talked about using hierarchical radiosity links in the
local pass (final one bounce gather to the viewpoint) by doing a
Weiler-Atherton
type subdivision of the unit hemisphere, using 3D coordinates of the unit
vectors, in order to determine the links involved at a pixel.
Mark Summinger from Erlangen University talked about decoupling the reflection
and transport operators in a progressive radiosity framework for non diffuse
surfaces. The shot and transported energy is saved in a data structure which is
indexed by both receiving position and angle bins. The advantage is that when
it is time to shoot for a patch, all the energy in an incoming angle bin can be
reflected at once, which requires fewer evaluations or accesses to the BDRF.

   The abstracts to these talks were handwritten into a Dagstuhl record book,
and are being transcribed to be sent to the participants and saved at Dagstuhl.
The proceedings of the next conference I attended, the 7th Eurographics
Workshop on Rendering, at Porto, Portugal, will be published rapidly by
Springer.

   At Porto, (and also at Dagstuhl) I spoke on "Hierarchical Rendering of Trees
from Precomputed Multi-Layer Z-Buffers". This is based on reprojecting images
of trees and their subparts, prerendered from different viewpoints (image based
rendering). Fabrice Neyret gave a related paper which had an impressive video
of a flight over a forest, produced by ray tracing hierarchical (mip mapped)
volume textures with an ellipsoidally approximated surface normal distribution
at each voxel.

   Fredo Durand, George Drettakis, and Claude Puesch gave a speculative talk on
an unimplemented method of dividing the 4D space of all lines in 3D up into
regions where the visibility along the ray is constant. To deal with rays which
have multiple segments in the free volume between objects, they use and extra
discrete dimension to index the segments, but the space of such segments still
has only 4 real parameters for a fixed scene. They discuss the various lower
dimensional manifolds of visibility change events that divide this space into
regions of homogeneous visibility, and show why the resulting data structure is
of size O(n^4), where n is the number of polygon edges, and can be constructed
by a sort and sweep algorithm in time O(n^4 log n). This is considerably better
than the aspect graph, of size O(n^6), because the aspect graph computes for
each viewing direction (or viewpoint) the intersection of the 2D pencil of
lines making up the image, with this subdivision of the 4D space of all
lines.Eric Veach pointed out that in the case of caustic maps under water, and
the case of bump mapped shading normals differing from the normals of the
surfaces which intercept the light transport rays, non symmetric scattering
functions (BDRFs or BDTFs) must be used, which do not satisfy reciprocity, and
therefore act differently when light energy or importance are being
transported, or equivalently, act differently for the two directions in
bidirectional path tracing (photon paths and viewing paths).

   Stephen Hardt and Seth Teller from MIT showed how the rendering pipeline and
texture mapping hardware with perspective correction of a high end workstation
could be cleverly used to produce accurate radiosity rendering at interactive
rates by fitting the radiosity off-line (ahead of time) by quadratic triangular
patches, and then using the hardware polygon renderer to deposit at each pixel
the polygon ID and two barycentric coordinates in the triangle. They use the
perspective correction in the texture mapper to get the barycentric coordinates
accurately. With Michael Allison, I showed in Graphic Gems III how the
barycentric coordinates could be stored in color fields, using only the Gouraud
shading interpolation hardware, if perspective corrections are not needed. The
radiosity is then computed in software as a quadratic polynomial in the two
barycentric coordinates, with coefficients indexed by the polygon ID.

   Jos Stam and Eric Languinou spoke about ray tracing in non-constant media
(mirages). Eric Lafortune and Yves Willems extended bidirectional path tracing
to the case of 3D volumes with participating media (smoke, steam, or clouds).
 George Dretakis and Francois Sillion spoke on incorporating discontinuity
meshing into hierarchical quadtree meshes, which allows large quadtree cells on
homogeneous unoccluded regions; previous discontinuity meshes based on BSP
trees had unnecessarily long edges crossing into regions beyond the
discontinuities that defined them.

   I spent the 6 days between the Porto and Chamonix conferences on vacation in
Portugal, cycling with my wife Mika from Coimbra to Alcobaca, on bicycles
kindly loaned by the local conference organizer, Augusto de Sousa, because
there were no bicycle rental shops in northern Portugal. The final day before
the Curves and Surfaces conference began was spent travelling from Porto to
Chamonix.

   The topics of the Chamonix conference were less familiar to me, being
weighted towards approximation theory based on functional analysis on Sobelov
spaces (I still haven't figured out what theses are) and wavelets. I attended
because Greg Nielson invited me to give a talk at a Mini-symposium he organized
an Scientific Visualization. I spoke on "Applications of Texture Mapping to
Volume and Flow Visualization," giving in 25 minutes almost all the content of
the version I also earlier presented at the University of Kaiserslautern in 65
minutes. In the same session, Marcus Gross gave a talk on "Finite Element
Modelling and Visualization for Facial Surgery," in which the soft tissues
between the bone and skin are modelled by finite elements, whose deformation is
simulated as bones are cut and displaced, so that the final appearance of the
face can be displayed before the operation is carried out.

   There were 6 days of mostly 3 parallel sessions of 25 minute talks form 8:30
AM until 6:30 PM (with a 2 hour break for lunch, and two half hour coffee
breaks) for 6 conference days, which made for a pretty grueling schedule. I
attended most of the time, but admit to "playing hooky" for two mornings in
order to enjoy the mountain scenery. I probably absorbed some approximation
theory by osmosis, especially from an excellent Mini-symposium on non-linear
and adaptive wavelet approximation, including talks by Yves Meyer on the bump
algebra, by S. Mallet on Image Compression, emphasizing the quantization and
coding of the wavelet or basis coefficients, and the coding of the position
indices of the non-zero coefficients, as well as just which coefficients can be
set to zero, and by Ron DeVore on adaptive numerical methods for partial
differential equations. There was also an interesting talk by A. Pinkus on
approximating by ridge functions, the set of finite linear combinations of
ridges, which are "long crested waves" of one linear parameter in 2 or 3
dimensions. There were many talks on extending the ideas of wavelets from the
plane to arbitrary 2-manifolds, and in particular, to the 2-sphere.

   Beyond these approximation theory talks, the talks I understood best were on
surface shape. There were a couple of talks on developable surfaces, which are
important in manufacturing because they can be formed from sheet metal without
stretching. An invited talk by Joseph Hoschek on interpolation and
approximation with developable surfaces gave an example of designing the blank
holder in a sheet metal forming process. This is the part of the mold which
should first clamp the sheet, without stretching it, and hold it while the part
of the deformation involving more severe stretching deformations takes place.
Another talk by Y. L. Kergosian analyzed the folds and cusps where a
developable surface can have singularities, and simulated them for the case of
a bent tin can, generating impressively realistic images.

   There was also a Mini-symposium on Multiresolution Methods in Computer
Graphics, including the following talks. Richard Bartels talked on hierarchical
splines. Peter Scrhvder spoke on spherical wavelets, and showed his Siggraph
'95 images. After hearing it for the nth time, I finally understood the idea
behind lifting. R. Westerman described his wavelet-based volume rendering, in
which the wavelets are used only for determining the appropriate adaptive
sampling frequency along a ray and for reconstructing the samples, for a
traditional opacity accumulation algorithm. Thus full opacity effects are
possible, in contrast to faster algorithms which try to precompute the splats
of each wavelet, and therefore cannot account for interwavelet opacity effects.
David Salesin presented three multiresolution techniques from his  past and
future Siggraph papers: image editing, image querying, and multiresolution
video "clip art".

 Some years ago, when Sbert & Pueyo showed me their method, I though
 about this objection, because it seems counter-intuitive that this
 selection of points on the sphere induces the correct density. But
 later I was convinced of it's correctnes, both by estimating that way
 form-factors whose value was analiticaly known a priori, and by 
 formal derivations from results in Integral Geometry theory.

 There is a formula on Santalo's book about Integral Geomtery which
 gives the density of the points of intersection of a convex object
 with lines of constant density in 3D. When instancing the convex
 object to a sphere, the density for intersections points becomes
 uniform. This is so because the formula involves the diferential 
 poin-to-point form factor between the two intersection points of 
 each line, an this value, in the case of a sphere, is a constant
 which only depends on sphere's radius. You can check this by
 seeing the internal angles of a triangle whose vertexs are these 
 two points and the center of the sphere.

 The refered formula is at the bottom of page 230 of:

    Integral Geometry and Geometric Probability.

I had claimed that the method used by Xavier Pueyo to generate uniformly
distributed lines inside a sphere, by joining pairs of points randomly
distributed on the sphere's surface, was incorrect, but Carlos Urena Almagro
has pointed out that it is I who was mistaken.

My reasoning was as follows. If uniformly distributed lines in a certain fixed
direction w intersect the unit sphere, they will not be uniformly distributed
on the surface area. Instead, lines making an angle of t with the surface
normal at their point of intersection will be less dense by a factor of cos t,
as in the geometrical reasoning behind Lambert's law.

However, I neglected to consider the solid angle effect. It turns out that the
chord length of the ray segment between sphere surface intersection points A
and B, is twice cos t. Therefore, the solid angle intercepted by a surface area
ds at A, as measured at B, is (ds cos t)/(2 cos t)^2 = ds/(4 cos t). The cos t
in the denominator here cancels the cos t for the Lambert area distribution
factor at B, so that the number of rays within an element ds dw, of
differential area ds  normal to the beam and differential solid angle dw, is
constant. (The cos t for the Lambert factor at A is already present in the
numerator at the left side of the above equation.)

Hi,
The prereleased version of my diplom (in german!) could be found at:
 http://www.rz.tu-ilmenau.de/~juhu/Diplom/juhudip.ps.gz

Be warned!(I've spend 1 year for hacking, but only 1 week for writing..:)
Below are some highlights of this work:

-Improvements for classical speedup-methodes, i.a:
   - the use of coherence for speedup-methodes (1D,2D,3D,5D)
   - projected area weighted, object intersection cost weighted ABVH
   - balanced BSP (to avoid the "Teapot in a football stadium" problem)
   - adaptive, "on the fly" subdivided Vista/Light-Buffer, applicable for
     volume-lightsources and extended cameras (There is a methode to avoid
     the "exhaustive classification/reclassification" effects, caused by 
     Monte-Carlo-rays bundles near a big lightsource)
   - 5D Ray Classification for groups of pointlightsources or for a 
     volume-lightsource w/ complicated shape

-Comparisons:
   - Heuristics for efficiencies/defficienies of classical methodes
   - How to determine the complexity of a scene ?
   - What methode is best (hehe) ?

-Hybrid-speeedup:
   - When to use, and how ?
   - Implemention of some hybrid shemes, such as hybrid-subdivision, local
     optimizaion for shadow/eye-rays (adaptive Vista/Light-Buffer for eye/shadow rays
     balaced BSP for secondary rays), generalized Polymorph-Caching etc..
   - Some speculations on hybrid-methodes, not much infomative...

   
I would like to hear your comments on this work....Thanks in advance,

Hi globillumers,

Is there a name for incoming flux per unit PROJECTED area?
Note that this is different from irradiance (incoming flux
per unit area). If there's a name, is there also a symbol
or letter commonly used to represent this quantity?

Thanks a bunch,

	Dani

The lighting community's bible, ANSI/IES RP-16, "Nomenclature
and Definitions for Illuminating Engineering," neatly sidesteps
this issue by saying in Clause 3.3 (which admittedly refers to
illuminance rather than irradiance) that the surface "need not
be a physical surface; it may also be a mathematical plane."
In other words, their definition of irradiance/illuminance
applies both to physical surfaces and imaginary surfaces (which
can include those normal to the direction of the incident flux).

You might find what you are looking for in Moon and Spencer's
"The Photic Field" (MIT Press, 1981), where I think they called
it "pharosage." However, adopting any of Parry Moon's terminology
(apart from his "radiosity") is an open invitation to be ignored
by the old guard in the IESNA :+)

Hi globillum folk;

I have a question regarding file formats used to store luminaire
goniometric data;  any help would be much appreciated.

Which file formats are in common useage in Japan and Germany?

I know the UK is keen on CIBSE.
I know the US is keen on IESNA.
I know a little about the CIE format (what I've read in Glassner's
"Principles ...")

But, I don't know what's popular in these two large market areas.

Thanks in advance

ANNOUNCE: 96/09/01 Release of RADBIB96
--------------------------------------
RADBIB96 is a comprehensive bibliography of radiosity and
related global illumination papers, theses, articles, and
books. A total of 41 new references have been added since
its last release on July 1, 1996, bringing the total to
975 references.

This bibliography is available in refer format (ASCII text)
as RADBIB96.TXT (with a release date of September 1, 1996)
from:

  http://www.ledalite.com/library-/rrt.htm

and as compressed RadBib96.Z from:

  ftp://hobbes.lbl.gov/pub/doc

A gzip-compressed BibTex-format version is available from:

  ftp.cs.columbia.edu/archives/bibliographies/Graphics/rad.html

but it may be a previous release.

As always, it is time-consuming and sometimes difficult to
track down conference papers and theses on radiosity and global
illumination. If you know of a relevant reference that is not
included in the bibliography, please let me know so that I can
include it in the next release.

Status: R

Hello colleagues

I have a problem relating to finding neighbouring voxels in octrees and
feel sure this must have been addressed previously.

I want to be able to find all the neighbouring (adjacent in space) voxels
from a given voxel stored in an octree. It seems feasible that an
operation based on traversal of the octree will allow neighbouring
voxels to be discovered.


Thanks in advance for any assistance

I have only done it with quadtrees, but I believe that you will find
simple code that does precisely that in one of H. Samet's book on 
hierarchical data structures.

One of the methods that Samet describes does not require neighbor
pointers (although that is certainly one way to do it), but instead you
ascend the tree until you can step in the direction you want, then you
descend the tree, staying as close spatially to the previous point as
possible, until you hit a leaf, or get to the level of the tree that
you desire.

With this method, you don't need neighbor pointers, just 8 child pointers
and 1 parent pointer.  Samet shows, as I recall, that you go up and down
2 times, on average, i.e. that the average cost to find a neighbor is O(1).
If you found neighbors by starting at the root every time,
it would cost O(depth).

Dear Collegues,

  I am working on speed-up of global illumination calculations and ray tracing for scenes
containing huge number of lights. Except some visibility pre-processing I would like to
limit number of considered lights for given space points doing some "light importance"
pre-processing. The tempting idea is to partition scene space into regions tied with
ordered lists of lights that can influence them, then, during calculation, process only 
those "significant" lights in order of their importance.

   I have browsed RadBIB and ACM Siggraph bibliographies but I have not found any
related papers. Have I missed something important ? Does anybody know about some
previous work on such or similar concepts ? 

Thanks in advance,

Slawek

You might find useful a look at 
Fournier, A., and Poulin, P.,
``A Ray Tracing Accelerator Based on a Hierarchy of 1D Sorted Lists'',
Proceedings of GI '93, Toronto, May 1993, pp. 53-61.

We used a hierarchy of bounding boxes aligned with the axes. This of course
determines an irregular grid on the scene, which is traversed by listing events
(entering and exiting a box) in 1D lists (one per coordinates). 
Many interesting conclusions, but the first one: "it's hard to beat regular
grid subdivision".

I had an MS student who did a thesis on the topic many (7? 8?) years
ago.  The main paper got turned down for SIGGRAPH.  The student took a
job and I left academia, so we never got the "improved" version
completed and accepted anywhere.  However, a description of a hardware
accelerator for it was accepted in a small conference.  The student
who did this work was Scott Senften (this year's SIGGRAPH Tutorial's
chair); you should be able to reach him at scott@lgc.com or
senften@siggraph.org.

I know k-d trees and space partitioning trees (BSP-trees) have also
been considered for this purpose, but I don't know if the work has
been published.

I hope that helps.

K-d trees for ray-tracing are described in K.R.Subramanian's PhD
thesis:

K.R.Subramanian
"Adapting Search Structures to Scene Characteristics for Ray Tracing"
Department of Computer Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin,
    Austin, TX 78712, December 1990

You may be able to obtain a copy from: trcenter@cs.utexas.edu

As for BSP-trees, I don't know of any paper describing their appli-
cation to ray-tracing, but the following paper discusses ways of 
constructing good BSP-trees for ray-tracing:

B.Naylor
"Constructing Good Partitioning Trees"

I never used grids for RT-speedup (memories!), but it should be possible to
construct a near-optimal BSP-tree and then convert it back to your grids.  
I dont think that grids are much faster than BSP, except you implement this alg.
in hardware. Another fact is that pure-spatial subdivision algorithms are 
almost always static and they all are based on some more or less efficient 
"heuristics", so it is very hard to obtain a really optimal subdivision. A
good idea is to bring some "intelligence" into your subdivision sheme, alias
hybrid-shemes. Especially for raytracing, i've some good results while
implementing some hybrid-shemes in GX: The speedup is about 300-500%
comparing to balanced BSP(!)

I agree entirely, nested grids looks like a big win:  you get the walking
efficiency of grids and so get to walk large empty spaces quickly with the
adaptive advantages of speed and robustness (rendering a teapot in a stadium
brings a single grid structure to its knees).

Frederic, if you've seen these, how does your work compare with their technique?

Personally, I use a variant of having the global grid store just object IDs,
then each object itself has a bounding volume and grid if needed.  The
advantage to me is ease of coding and tight bounds - the same generic grid code
is used for both, and the object's bounding box defines its grid size.  Also,
this method has the advantage of an intermediate bounding volume test before
going into the nested grid, as a global grid cell may have a tiny object or a
small part of some object in it, in which case you would normally spend (with
just nested grids) a fair bit of time traversing the nested grid for no
intersection.  I need the bounding box test anyway to get a ray starting point
for the object's grid.

Hello,

here are my $0.02 about speeding up ray-tracing with spatial
subdivisions.

the following elements are based upon a paper presented at
Eurographics 95 (so see the proceedings or plug into
http://flamingo.stanford.edu/~cazals/xfc_research.html and get the
first paper) called 'Filtering, clustering and hierarchy construction:
a new solution for ray tracing complex scenes'

-so far, it seems that the fastest data structures are the recursive
grids roughly built as follows: subdivide the bounding box of n
objects into \sqrt[3]{n} subdivisions along the x,y and z axis, and
iterate in each voxel containing more than MAX items --where MAX is
some constant, say 50. of course, getting the right value for MAX in
order to have a good tradeoff speed/memory requirements is the tricky
point and that's one of the reasons why we came up with the Hierarchy
of Uniform Grids (hug :))

-it is not obvious that non uniform subdivision implies 'heuristic that
will fail in some particular case'. see the intuition provided by what
is known about the asymptotic complexity of bucket sort vs. quick sort
in our paper and how this should help in capturing the statistical
properties of complex scenes

 there are three major differences:
 
 -while D. Jevans's data structure is built top-down, ours is
 built bottom-up
 
 -we do not have any hand tuned parameter while he has two of them: the
 max number of items per voxel and the max hierarchy depth
 
 -he assumes that he has an efficient dynamic hashing algorithm to
 store the non-empty voxels since he does not know beforehand how many
 such voxels he is going to end up with, while the only data structures
 we are using are arrays and lists (allocated once for all and thus not
 causing any memory fragmentation problem).

Title:

Mathematical Frameworks and Monte Carlo Algorithms for Global Illumination
in Computer Graphics

Abstract:

The title of this thesis `Mathematical Frameworks and Monte Carlo Algorithms
for Global Illumination in Computer Graphics' refers to a domain in the field
of computer graphics known as photo-realistic image rendering or global
illumination. The goal of this domain is to compute realistic pictures of a
three-dimensional scene, as could have been observed by a human observer or
more precisely, a camera.

The first part of this work describes the physical and mathematical
foundations which are needed in order to describe the global illumination
problem. The fundamental physical measure needed to describe the distribution
of light in an environment is radiance. The equation describing the transport
of radiance is a recursive integral equation. The dual problem introduces
potential as a basic measure, and the potential equation as the corresponding
transport equation. Both dual formulations can be used in order to solve the
global illumination problem.

Once the mathematical framework has been developed, the equations describing
the transport of light or potential can be solved. Due to the high number of
integrals and the complexity and unknown behaviour of the functions to be
integrated, Monte Carlo integration provides a viable method of computing
the global illumination in a three-dimensional scene. Depending on the
choice of what transport equation to use, the radiance transport equation
leads to distributed ray tracing or path tracing, and the potential transport
equation leads to light tracing or particle tracing. The latter method
generates particles at the light sources, which each carry a small amount
of power. They carry out a random walk in the three-dimensional scene, and
possibly contribute their power to the flux of a pixel on the screen.
Mathematically, this algorithm can be considered as the dual algorithm of
ray tracing.

The sampling functions used for the generation of the random walks can be
based on reflective properties of the surfaces encountered. However, in
diffuse environments, better results can be expected when they are based
on the (unknown) potential distribution. Since the optimal sampling function
is not known in advance, one solution is to use adaptive probability density
functions. As more particles are being generated, the potential distribution
can be approximated more accurately, and thus a better sampling function can
be constructed. This technique requires a substantial amount of memory, but
produces better results. The used sampling algorithms can also be extended
to other Monte Carlo rendering algorithms, such as bidirectional path tracing.

 Salut !

 I was doing my radiosity project when I realized that the approximate 
"differential area - to - disk" form factor formula

 FF = cos(a)*cos(b)*R^2 / (R^2 + h^2)

given in so many books for numerical form factor integration gives in most cases 
100%-200% numerical errors (!) .  I had to derive the exact general analytic solution for 
this case, which was possibly known before ( do you have any references ?), but 
apparently was never recommended for practical use (to my knowledge). This exact formula 
is not very complicated compared to its widely used approximation, but it produces much 
more accurate results.  It is also computationally simpler than the exact formulas known 
for other geometries (such as point-to-polygon); I think it makes this solution very 
useful.  If it sounds interesting or if you faced any form factor computing problems 
before, please give me some feedback. 
 I am also interested in any related open research problems.

Dear Collegues,

A month ago (September 7th) I asked for help in finding papers
related to the project I was involved in - speed up of shadows 
analysis. I would like to thank once again all those who answered
my query. Below you'll find the small bibliography I have completed.
I hope it may be of some use for someone who will encounter the
same problem.

  For those who are interested in "quick fix" of performance of
a ray tracer with shadows calculated by ray casting I may honestly
devise the Greg Ward's method described in "Adaptive Shadow Testing for
Ray Tracing". It gave average speed-up factor varying from 1.5 - 5.0
calculated on models build of 10,000 - 40,000 polygons, with 50 - 400
lights. The differences in resultant images were not noticeable. In
absolute terms (number of differing pixels and magnitude of differences)
the differences were smaller than introduced by standard JPEG
compression.

Excellent to give this overview of your experiences and results.

The second EG Workshop on Rendering was held in May(!) 1991.
And the proceedings are published as
  P. Brunet, F.W. Jansen (eds)
  Photorealistic  Rendering  in  Computer  Graphics,  
  Springer Verlag, 1994 (!)
  ISBN 3-540-56449-7 or 0-387-56449-7

The papers mentioned appear at the following pages:

Ward, "Adaptive Shadow Testing for Ray Tracing,"  p. 11 - 20.
Shirley, "Direct  Lighting Calculation ...", p. 54 - 59.
Kok and Jansen, "Source Selection for ....", p. 75 - 82.

I would like to suggest that the papers are referenced as dating
from 1991 instead of 1994 the year the Springer proceedings were published.
The latest RW proceedings (Rendering Techniques'9x) are now fortunately
published within the same year as the workshop has been held.

I often ask myself : Monte-Carlo ray-tracing, is this the way to do
globillum in the future? After reading a lot of papers aboud MC-methods, i still get
confused w/ their terminologies. I can't see any advantage of these methods
over traditional methods (radiosity), except the fact that meshing is not
needed, and that you can do reference-images for RMS-benchmark(!)

For me, the most important feature of a rendering method is not its
physical-correctness, but its efficiency and visual-asthetic-possibilty.
With MC-rendering, i must spend lot of works to develope specific sampling 
shemes and reasonable 'good' estimators. Even w/ that, i still get useless
images (too noisy!), or i must increase the sampling rate and wait forever...
It is not always true that most people find noises less obsevable than aliasing.(
i.e white pixels in a dark-corner vesus aliased dark-lines) .

Especially for the direct lighting computation, MC-methods are definitely 
*NOT* the way to go. : The most regions of an image are not in shadow, so why 
should we cast so many shadow-rays to the light-source ? In fact, we dont 
need to cast any
shadow-rays, if the visibilities are known a priory ( w/ shaftculling) and
the radiance comming from the light can be easly computed (analytically).
Only for the case, that complex-shadow occurs, MC-sampling would be
helpfull. Also for this case, the soft-shadow generated w/ them can be much
better without increasing the sampling rate ( We simple smooth the
shadow-regions, visual-aesthetic, not physical-correct!).

Of course, i could be wrong:)

Why do folks bother at all with Monte Carlo methods for global
illumination? Complexity. 

Think of the problem of computing the irradiance at a given point. Do
you want to go around the whole environment, calculating the
irradiance from every object, regardless of occlusion or distance from
the point? Or do you want to probe the environment, spending similar
effort for every incident direction? This is the basic choice between
mesh-based methods and Monte Carlo calculations. For simple
environments, the mesh-based methods are excellent; they give no noise
artifacts, and computation is tractable. For extremely complex
environments, mesh-based algorithms tend to get inefficient.

Actually, the mesh-based world and Monte Carlo are working toward each
other. Hierarchical meshing is basically a way to make a mesh-based
algorithm behave more like Monte Carlo, spending effort for irradiance
contributions rather than for geometric complexity. And any
well-designed Monte Carlo calculation uses deterministic methods
wherever practical, and attempts to take advantage of spatial
coherence. The ultimate global illumination method will probably be a
hybrid of Monte Carlo and mesh-based methods.

This isn't directly related to global illumination, but does relate to
physically-based rendering.

Does anyone know where one might get a real camera lens measured in
order to calibrate it -- i.e., the distortion, chromatic abberations,
intensity falloff, etc?  I'd like to plug the results into a rendering
system to get good approximations of a physical lens, but I have no
data...

It doesn't have to be a free service, but those are (of course)
preferred.  I've heard several rumors about a "European" company that
does this sort of thing (for a large fee), but that's the entire rumor.

Please respond to me directly, since I don't want to fill your mailboxes
with non-related junk.  I'll post a summary of responses in a week.

I've researched using the Tsai method for calibration, but that uses
video cameras and iteration... I would like to be able to measure lenses
used for film cameras.

I've actually implemented shaft-culling for complex-scenes in GX/GENERIC.
Not really shaft-culling, but a combined version of Arvo's hyperoctree and
Haines's light-buffer. It's definitely faster than pur MC, because the cost
for collision-test between a beam and a bbox is quite the same between a ray and
a bbox.

There is a lot of confusion on this because we all over-hype our
methods in papers (me included) and as reviewers and authors we
are sloppy about making people carefully characterize their methods.

Here-- I will make up four scenes:

 1. Lambertian Cornell box
 2. Lambertian Cornell box w/smooth metal box
 3. Lambertian Cornell box w/glass sphere instead of short block
 4. Semi-matte (direction diffuse) Cornell box
 5. Semi-matte (direction diffuse) Cornell box with "real object (10^6 patches) 

1. Traditional world-space FE will work easily and we can do a walkthrough.
   RADIANCE will also work easily, but will not in practice allow a 
   walkthrough-- the view-independent info is there, but it is not
   easily accessible.  MCPT (Monte Carlo path tracing) will take all day,
   but will give an unbiased image (so what?).

2. Now radiosity has problems.  We can add a virtual world, or
   use particle-tracing based radiosity with a density estimation
   post-process, but then doing the walktrhough is a problem.
   RADIANCE does fine for a given viewpoint, and we can re-use the
   irradiance map.  MCPT will have LOTS of noise on the ceiling
   unless very good importance sampling is used.

3. Uh-oh-- particle tracing based radiosity works.  RADIANCE and
   MCPT will have a very noisy caustic under the ball (although
   RADIANCE will not have this problem for the important
   glass case-- windows!).

4. Ouch.  Sillion-style FE works, as does Jensen's photon map.
   MCPT is so dumb, it doesn't realize that this case is
   harder than Lambertian.  RADIANCE will not work because it
   caches irradiance, so it will degenerate to MCPT (really, you
   can treat secondary bounces as Lambertian-- I believe this
   is a good move in almost all scenes, but it is hard to
   quantitatively justify).

5. Ouch^2.  FE runs out of memory FAST.  MCPT works no worse
   than 4.  Jensen's photon map also works, but will be
   storage-intensive if the object is not very smooth.  Radiance will
   perform as in 4.


In summary, pure MCPT has only two advantages-- it is so dumb 
that it doesn't get hit by big scenes, and it is easy to implement.
If you want an interactive walkthrough, then you are currently
limited to radiosity (I use that term for all world space
irradiance calculating alg's), and that limits you to
a relatively small scene (100k initial polygons will kill
almost all radiosity implementations).

I agree with the above, and I think the solution is hybrid methods--
add bias!  (This is blasphemy in MC circles :^) ).  I do want to
keep the good parts of MC methods-- they are damned robust and
are possible to implement correctly-- my MC code does not
bomb on wierd untweaked inputs-- tell me with a straight face
that is true of most non-MC implementations.  However, you
are right that the results are too noisy!!!  We can keep these benefits
and reduce noise if we add bias the right way (not that I know what
that right way is).

I welcome you to implement shaft-culling on scene 5 above.  Slower 
than MC, and will usually core-dump even with a year
of implementation I'll bet.  Now shaft culling
on simplified geometries (which it sounds like you might be suggesting)
sounds like a very good idea.  Only use MC when needed-- yes, definitely smart.

Overall, this has got me to again reflect on the state of our field.
It is VERY hard to get a rendering paper into SIGGRAPH, even with
good reviews.  It is easy to get toys based on low-handing fruit into SIGGRAPH.
Clearly we are doing something very wrong (you could rightly argue SIGGRAPH is
doing something wrong, but that wont change anything-- we have to figure
out where our share of the blame is).  I think this is partially because most
graphics people think TOY STORY graphics is good enough.  I, however, want
virtual reality that looks REAL and is predictive-- I don't want
a virtual cartoon world.  We are very far from getting things
to look real, and from understanding our algorithms' behaviors.
No working program gives useful error estimates.  We have 
totally inadequate local reflection models.  Most algorithms
are memory hogs and don't parallelize.  Most algorithms
do a very poor job with dielectrics (water, glass).  I think
we need to make our own "grand challenge" models, and publicize
that they can't currently be done (e.g, a human at a desk illuminated
through a skylight), so that our field wont dry up and blow away.

One of the big advantages of MC algorithms is that they let you
model the scene you actually want to use.  Sure, radiosity
algorithms can be efficient --- if we limit ourselves to diffuse
surfaces, with maybe a few mirrors or whatever that are handled
in a ray-tracing pass.  But flat polygons and diffuse reflectors
do not go very far in modeling the real world, and finite-element
algorithms don't seem to be practical for much more than this.
(Memory usage blows up for complex scenes, or when there are lots
of glossy surfaces.)

This is an important issue in graphics, since often the biggest
source of error is the scene model itself.  What good is an
accurate solution to the wrong scene model?  At least MC
algorithms start with the desired input.  Even if you aren't
interested in physically correct results, diffuse surfaces lead
to that wonderful "computer graphics look" we all know and love.

It's no wonder that radiosity algorithms tend to be faster, since
they are solving a much simpler problem: the solution is only a
two-dimensional function rather than a four-dimensional one.  To
me, the amazing thing is that radiosity algorithms need to be so
*complicated* to be efficient.  By the time you implement
discontinuity meshing, hierarchical basis functions, clustering,
shaft culling, etc., how many lines of code are we talking about?
And can you actually trust it not to core-dump, and to compute a
reasonable result in a reasonable amount of time?

And let's not kid ourselves that an algorithm is "general" just
because it can handle a few mirrors or glossy surfaces.  The real
test of generality is how an algorithm performs when there are
*no* diffuse surfaces, since that's how it is in the real world.

Another reason to use MC algorithms is scene complexity.  Finite
element algorithms work with explicit representations of the
scene and its properties.  They are strongly affected by the size
and complexity of the scene representation.  On the other hand,
Monte Carlo algorithms are based on sampling, which means that
the scene model is accessed through a small set of queries (e.g.
what is the first surface point intersected by this ray?)  This
hides the scene complexity behind a layer of abstraction, and can
mean that rendering times are only loosely coupled to the scene
representation (e.g. it may affect the time required to cast a
ray).  In effect, Monte Carlo algorithms can sample the scene to
determine the information they actually need, while deterministic
algorithms examine every detail, whether it is relevant or not.

That's not to say that MC algorithms need to sample *everything*.
It's perfectly reasonable to embed deterministic calculations
within a Monte Carlo framework, especially for low-dimensional
integration problems (e.g.\ direct lighting from a small number
of uniform, diffuse, polygonal luminaires).  Sometimes this
introduces bias, but often this is okay, especially when we can
bound the errors or at least characterize them.

Ideally, rendering algorithms should not depend on the details of
the scene representation, but only on the underlying mathematical
model.  For example, a square area light source can be simulated
fairly well with a ten by ten array of point sources, but many
rendering algorithms would have a much worse performance in the
second case.  Similarly, if we replace the square light source by
two flourescent bulbs covered by a diffusely transmitting panel,
why should it make a huge difference to our algorithms?  The same
comments apply to geometric complexity: if we represent an indoor
plant as a thousand polygons or a million Bezier patches, how
much should the rendering time go up?

I can't say that MC algorithms have achieved this level of
isolation from the scene representation, but at least it seems
that the opportunity is there.  There has been a lot of emphasis
on rendering algorithms that exploit special properties of the
input scene, e.g. that lighting is direct rather than through a
diffusing panel or bouncing off the ceiling.  It would be nice to
see more work on algorithms whose performance does not go down
the tubes when these conditions are not met, i.e. algorithms that
are more *robust*.  It seems that this should be possible without
resorting to the level of "dumbness" found in MCPT (as Pete
Shirley put it).

I guess the last major issue for MC algorithms is the correctness
of the results.  Here it is important to distinguish between
unbiased, biased, and consistent estimators.  Intuitively, an
unbiased estimator computes the right answer, on average.  A
biased estimator computes the wrong answer, on average.  A
consistent estimator also computes the wrong answer, on average,
but the error can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the
number of samples.  Most of the "biased" algorithms in graphics
are in fact consistent, otherwise we wouldn't have any confidence
at all in their results.

The main advantage of unbiased algorithms is that they make it
far easier to estimate the error in a solution.  For unbiased
algorithms, this error can be estimated by the sample variance,
since any error is guaranteed to show up as random variation
among the samples.  Thus, if an unbiased image is not noisy, we
can be reasonably sure that it is correct.  For scene of
realistic complexity, this seems to be the only practical way to
generate correct images.

For algorithms which are merely consistent, however, we must also
bound the bias.  In general this is difficult to do; we cannot
estimate bias by simply drawing a few more samples.  Bias shows
up as results that are not noisy, but in fact are incorrect.  In
graphics algorithms, this error is often noticeable visually, in
the form of discontinuities, excessive blurring, or surface
shading that just looks wrong.

Other things being equal, it is clear that we should prefer an
unbiased algorithm.  If these algorithms were also robust and
efficient, then why would we want to use anything else?  However,
conventional wisdom says that unbiased methods are "too expensive",
and that we can achieve an acceptable image in less time by making
approximations.

But where is the research to support this claim?  There has been
a huge amount of effort on approximate methods in graphics, while
there has been hardly any work on unbiased algorithms.  Some
people seem to think that "unbiased" is a synonym for "pure Monte
Carlo path tracing".  Until we have thoroughly explored this type
of algorithm, we can hardly make judgements on their
capabilities.  I would like to see more results on what can and
cannot be achieved by unbiased methods, so that we can make
better decisions on these issues.

(Can you tell that I'm writing a thesis? :-)

The Q matrix is mentioned in just about every piece of documentation
that deals with intersecting a ray with a quadratic, but none of the
documentation states how to construct the matrix.

The only documentation I can find deals with the Q matrix when the
quadratic is in homogeneous coordinates where most of the variables
in the Q matrix go to zero.

To work around this problem, I've seen solutions to translate the 
quadratic back to the origin, scale , and then rotate to lie on the
axis.  Now use the homogeneous Q matrix for intersection.

Does anyone know how to construct the Q matrix when the quadratic
is not in homogeneous unit coordinates ?

Well, I have to take exception with this statement, at least for now
(sorry Holly :-)).  The lumigraph and light fields are for the space
around convex regions of the environment (inside the "slabs") or for a
free space region inside an interior scene.  Freedom of movement
(quick indexing of the data structure) can be done using hardware
texturing which is nice, but the method is not applicable for any
environments I would consider outstanding.  Being able to orbit around
or pan near a small cluster of objects is not much more novel than the
capabilities supplied in Quicktime VR and I don't know of many
interior scenes that have lots of free space (pathways without
occlusions like columns, or furniture).

There is a simple modification of light-fields that allows full range
of motion within computer-rendered scenes that is equally as efficient
as the original implementation, but you'll have to wait for my newest
work to be done :-).

And if you want moving objects in your scene (a sense of time)...

Quick remark (and boy, have I been wrong before): I think the light field
techniques are very interesting and valuable, but not as primary rendering
techniques (if they were ever intended that way). They will be especially
useful when merged with CG scenes rendered from models (with global
illum, natch, also merging with real scenes won't hurt).

I vote for consistent MC-methods since they really are significantly faster
than the unbiased methods we have seen so far. Just take the irradiance
gradient caching scheme by Greg Ward and the photon map :)

It's true that the error can be estimated for unbiased methods but 
this estimate is probabilistic which in my opinion makes it less useful
since you cannot really trust your result but only be "reasonably sure"
that it is correct.

You can solve all rendering problems using unbiased techniques such
as path tracing and bidirectional path tracing. But for certain problems
these methods are *very* inefficient. Path tracing is not practical for
rendering caustics. Bidirectional path tracing is much better at visualizing
caustics but it fails when it comes to rendering the mirror reflection
of caustics (created by a small light source). Consider for example a glass 
of cognac on a procedural surface :) Even bidirectional path tracing would
have a hard time computing the illumination of the surface just below
the glass and it would be very costly (and time-consuming) computing 
billions of intersection points with a complex procedural surface.
This problem is much easier to solve if you allow storing illumination
information in the model (=bias).

The point is that you can't judge the whole class of unbiased
algorithms based on a couple of examples.  If you had an
unbiased algorithm that was just as fast, wouldn't you use it?
Such an algorithm doesn't exist yet, but we haven't seen any
solid evidence that this goal is impossible.  It's going to take
more research before we know what can be achieved.

Well, that's still better than no error estimates at all, which
is what you get with biased or consistent algorithms.

For example, let's consider your photon map.  I like this
algorithm, and I think it's a great practical tool.  But like
many consistent algorithms, it can make large errors that are
difficult to characterize (as I'm sure you are aware).  Let's
look at some of the situations where this happens.

For some scenes, the results can be wrong by an arbitrary amount.
The cognac glass sitting on a fractal surface is a perfect
example.  Given some point "x" to be shaded, you find the
smallest sphere centered at "x" that encloses N photon hits.
Then you estimate irradiance by assuming that the scene is
locally planar, i.e. its intersection with the interior of the
sphere is approximately a flat *disc*.  Thus to get irradiance,
the power carried by each photon is divided by (Pi * r^2).

This obviously doesn't make any sense for a fractal surface.  The
area of the surface within a sphere of radius "r" is much larger
than Pi * r^2 (for a true fractal, the area would be infinite,
but even for the reasonably fine subdivisions you are using, it
would be significantly higher).  So, the caustics in your images
are probably much brighter than they should be.

Similarly, the disc estimate will be substantially wrong near
corners, or for narrow objects (dangling power cords, wire cages,
blades of grass), or for parallel surfaces that are close
together (e.g. a slide tray, or vertical blinds).  The errors are
not small -- we're talking about factors of two, or ten, or even
a hundred.  The error depends on the ratio of the true surface
area over which the photons are distributed, vs. the area of the
approximating disc.

Now, the photon map is a consistent estimator, so these errors
will get smaller as the number of photons is increased.  But for
these examples, it would take incredible numbers of photons to
get a reasonable error.  Let's consider the handle on my coffee
mug.  It has a diameter of about 1cm.  For the disc estimate to
be reasonable (say within 20%), the diameter of the corresponding
sphere must be a couple of millimeters at most.  This sphere is
supposed to enclose N=50 or so photons, according to your rules
of thumb, so this implies a density of about ten million photon
hits per square meter.  Since all of these photons are stored in
a search tree, the memory requirements would be ridiculous for
typical scenes.

These kinds of errors are typical of many rendering algorithms
that are only claim consistency.  I have just been using the
photon map as an example.  In fact, it would be my first choice
for some applications.  Let's face it, we are stuck with consistent
algorithms for many problems (until something better comes along).

However, I don't think it's fair to compare the photon map with
an unbiased algorithm like bidirectional path tracing.  Sure,
there are situations where bidirectional path tracing does not
work well either, but at least the errors can be detected and
estimated by means of the sample variance.

I agree that the basic photon map implementation can give large errors.
These errors can be reduced by using different filtering techniques but
still, I agree, if you want absolute confidence in your result you may
need a large number of photons.

The same does, however, apply to path tracing. A student of mine recently
investigated the error estimates for unbiased path tracing. His results
indicate that just having a confidence of 15% (five percent) that you
are within 1% of the correct result required for most pixels thousands
of sample rays and for some pixels (such as the edges of light sources)
the number of rays exploded.

But I must admit that I really like the unbiased path tracing algorithms 
and they would be my choice if I wanted to have absolute confidence in the
result. They are, however, not very practical for everyday rendering.

  Werner Purgathofer did a nice analysis of the number of samples

  Using his methodology, and taking into account the dynamic range

I think this brings up the best motivation of all.  Unbiased algorithm, then 
filtering for results.  Not being a MC person myself, has work been done in 
this manner.  It always seems that the algorithms themselves are either 
unbiased (with proponents talking about error bounds and validation), or 
biased (with proponents talking about consistency and/or promoting the "look" 
of the results).  It seems like efficiency increases with error bounds (even 
if they are conservative) can best be accomplished by meeting in the middle.

You can also filter an image generated by a consistent Monte Carlo renderer
and obtain "good quality" much faster. I seem to remember that the 
"Energy Preserving Non-Linear Filters" paper also presented a technique 
for filtering images generated by Radiance (= a consistent but biased
MC renderer).

The formula actually uses the *projected area* which is well-defined
even for a fractal surface. And we do not need the normal if the 
reflection model for the fractal is Lambertian :)

I wonder if any of you have read carefully through Foley Van Dam's explanation
of diffuse reflection. The explanation is either misleading or incorrect.
Lambert's law is claimed to be related to the viewer location/angle.. I quote,

"...Second, we must consider the amount of light seen by the viewer. Lambertian
surfaces have the property, often known as Lambert's law, that the amount
of light reflected from a unit differential area dA towards the viewer is
directly proportional to the cosine of the angle  between the direction of
viewer and N..."

They go on to use this to explain how the intensity is constant in all
directions. However, on the one hand the angle theta is between the
normal and the light vector, while the second angle is between the viewer
and N. These are certainly not the same.

I guess the "What's wrong w/ Monte-Carlo methods?" thread has

art" in Global Illum more than any paper would have IMHO. I'd like to
give my 2p if it's not too late:

This just illustrates the time/space trade-off in global
illumination. Naive MCPT is so "dumb" it keeps throwing away
intermediate results that could come in handy when the next path gets
traced. I know there are some intersection acceleration techniques to
exploit path coherency but very few exploit coherency in the radiance
function (for instance, irradiance caching in RADIANCE).

Which is the motivation for importance (or Pattanaik's potential)

It's a pity that intrisically MCPT is not really hierarchical. It may use
a hierarchical data structure for every intersection but it is
essentially a point sampling method. In Fast Multipole Methods the
physical characteristics stored at each interior node serves as a
course representation of that stored by the descendant nodes in the
heirarchy thus interactions can be computed without descending all the
way to the leaves. As all point samples in MCPT are independent they
must all descend to the leaves of the data structure to determine on
an individual basis how each gets reflected.

Unanswered questions:
Should we, and how do we, make MCPT more like FMM?
Or should Hierarchical FE be made more like MCPT?
In short, what form should this hybrid take?

Same applies to finite element methods. This thread has been judging
the relative merits of MCPT and FE on the basis of what can currently
be done practically. I say we also need to look at their potential for
future improvements. We criticise FE's inability to deal with gloss
based upon methods that apply meshing to 2D surfaces. But the global
plenoptic function is 5-dimensional and have there been any attempts
at discretizing this space? (Drettakis et al.'s visibility complex is
a start...)

...as well as for FE and true hierarchical methods. IMO visibilty has
been handled poorly in FE radiosity, often reducing to a MonteCarlo
approach of casting rays between patches and/or clusters. Is there a
robust algorithm that reliably implements the triage concept
(i.e. doesn't say two patches are fully occluded simply
because the 16 rays cast between them so happened to hit the cloud of
intervening occluders).


> To me, the amazing thing is that radiosity algorithms need to be so
> *complicated* to be efficient.

I get this same feeling for MCPT. We now have irradiance caching, a
variety of intersection acceleration methods, special cases for direct
illumination, luminaire classification schemes based on significance,
caustic and photon-mapping pre-passes, special closed form analytical
BRDFs, "imposter" substitution for indirect luminaires (or whatever the
correct term for it is...), etc. Of course, once you've implemented
all these you'd be able to handle a much wider domain of problems than
current FE methods, but I bet you'll still miss your deadline.



** On memory management and parallelism

Pete:
> Most algorithms are memory hogs and don't parallelize.

This enters into the field of operating systems. My opinion is that
most OS designs have been based on applications of the 70's and
before. Back then there was little use of dynamic data structures.  It
would be a mistake to design a globillum application to fit into this
framework.

Things are improving with new research into microkernels which can
allow one to specify user defined virtual memory systems specially
taylored for the demands of particular algorithms. On the parallelism
front computational scientists are increasingly moving toward adaptive
irregular computations (a behaviour so common in MCPT and HR)
necessitating runtime support for multi-threading and asynchronous
control. My belief is that most MCPT and FE radiosity methods can be
expressed in a multithreaded asynchronous style to make use of these
innovations.



** Grand Challenge models

A Great Idea!

Eric Veach:

> *no* diffuse surfaces, since that's how it is in the real world.

Additionally:

(i) when 90% of the scene is outside the viewing frustum but may still
influence the illumination of the visible geometry. How would the
photon map perform on a 5 story architecture where the janitor has
left the light on inside a closed closet? How does MCPT perform on the
nested labyrinth models used by Smits (SigGraph 1992)?

This and Eric Veach's comment below makes the case for importance estimation
which can be done by FE also:
> In effect, Monte Carlo algorithms can sample the scene to

> algorithms examine every detail, whether it is relevant or not.


(ii) when feature sizes vary over several orders of magnitude (such as
fractals). A pathological case would be to render a scene of a pile of
sand where part of the view is through a powerful magnifying
glass. Contrived though it is, it illustrates where a sort of
multi-resolution BRDF would come in handy so that samples passing
through the magnifying glass make use of the detailed BRDF of the sand
particles, whereas indirect illumination reflecting off the entire
pile uses the courser BRDF representation. Has there been any research
into generating a multi-resolution BRDF like this automatically? The
current technique is to use imposters but this requires user
intervention. This would help handle this model:

These will make great Grand Challenge problems! Someone should
catalogue pathological cases with explanations why each of the
currently available techniques perform poorly.

We can make this another Grand Challenge problem. Picture a messy

caustics onto Eric's mug. (Do you have a NURBS description of that?)

I'm confused. Does the formula apply if the fractal surface self occludes?
What about fractally defined aggregate surfaces (e.g. a ball of cotton)

Not necessarily bound it but *blend* it between visually coherent
regions such that the bias is not noticeable. I know the
scientifically correct way would be to bound bias, but if the end
product is an aesthetic image rather than actual luminance statistics,
you can probably produce something acceptable by removing unnecessary
variation via judicious use of interpolation. This amounts to
filtering over the finite elements of course.

I didn't mean to write this much... Just that no one else was speaking
up for FE. Please feel free to rebut since I'm about to invest a
massive amount of time implementing a hairy hierarchical global
illumination multigridded FE method with importance sampling etc. :-)

Depends on what is meant by "amount of light". If referring to energy
or power directed towards the viewer then this is correct. Since
radiance is constant over the hemisphere the "amount of light" will
depend on area projected by the unit differential area towards the
viewer which will indeed be proportional to the cosine of the angle
between N and view direction.(A simple check: if N is at right angles to your
view, the differential area is a silhouette, projects zero area on the
image, hence cannot be seen)

In practice this calculation is taken care of by the
perspective/orthographic projection or by sampling in the image
domain. Most implementations take the cosine of the angle between N
and a light source direction in order to estimate how much light
energy was being intercepted by the surface in the first place to
determine what constant value the radiance will take. It is misleading
in that the terminology isn't quite clear. (Did that make any sense or
did I just make a fool of myself?)

Subject: Lens Calibration summary
Status: R

I got so caught up in the FE vs. MCPT thread, I forgot to post the
summary of lens calibration responses that I got.

I got several possibilities, and even found that elusive "company" in
europe that I had heard abnout.

It turns out that the "company" is actually a photogrammetry department
at University College London, and they will measure lenses for a fee of
522.50 pounds (see attached message for address, etc.).

Michael Cohen reports that Tsai's method is satisfactory for most uses
as long as you can get the images scanned in reliably.  The drawbacks I
see are that Tsai's method only models radial distortion, and doesn't
handle any chromatic or intensity issues.

I also found a piece of Macintosh photogrammetry software that will take
an image which contains their calibration target and provide you with
radial distortion and other information about the camera system.  It is
designed for CCDs, but reportedly could be used for any camera system
where the scanning of the image was consistent.  The name of the
software is "Opti-CAL", and the contact for information is
gchow@kinetic.bc.ca.  If anyone is interested, I have a technical
summary that they sent me on the product.

Ken Musgrave's friend (who is a lens designer) suggested that if one
wishes to model the optics directly to determine a mapping (as in Craig
Kolb's SIGGRAPH paper), lens patent descriptions may be used to find out
information on the configurations of the lenses.

We do have a service for calibrating cameras in our dept.

We normally deal with photogrammetric metric cameras, but can 
also measure semi and non metric cameras.

We calibrate for lens distortion, principle distance, and principle
point position.  However we do not consider chromatic abberation 
or intensity falloff.

We do charge for this service, if you send the camera to us then
we will carry out the calibration and issue a certificate for

David Salesin was kind enough to forward the following message to me,
and I figured that I'd try to address it. 

First of all, let me admit that our book has many errors, all of which we
try to track in our "Bug List," which is available by sending mail
to graphtext@cs.brown.edu. 

But I believe that the "error" below is one of the (many?) places where we 
actually got it right. 

> "...Second, we must consider the amount of light seen by the viewer. Lambertian
> surfaces have the property, often known as Lambert's law, that the amount
> of light reflected from a unit differential area dA towards the viewer is
> directly proportional to the cosine of the angle  between the direction of
> viewer and N..."

I believe that the statement above is correct; but you need to note that 
it says that the amount reflected *from a unit differential area* is
proportional to the cosine of the *view-to-normal* angle. But a single
bit of your eye (one receptor, for example) will actually see more
or less surface depending on the viewing angle. That's what the
next sentence says:

  "...Since the amount of surface area seen is inversely proportional
  to the cosine of this angle, these two factors cancel out."

The phrase "this angle" has antecedent "the angle between the direction
to the viewer and N", and "two factors" has antecedents "directly proportional
to the cosine of ..." and "inversely proportional to the cosine of...".

> They go on to use this to explain how the intensity is constant in all
> directions. However, on the one hand the angle theta is between the
> normal and the light vector, while the second angle is between the viewer
> and N. These are certainly not the same. 

The symbol theta is only used to denote the angle between the direction
to the light source and the normal. The direction-to-viewer/normal angle
is not given a symbol anywhere in the discussion, but is simply 
described as it is used, two times (which happen to cancel out). 

   *   *   *

Paul Heckbert also commented on Gamma Correction. There, too, I think
that the explanation is correct, although I personally am not in love
with the presentation of the material -- if we were to do it over again,
and I had a chance to rewrite *that* bit, I'd be inclined to do it 
differently. 

Anyhow, I feel sure that I speak for my coauthors as well when I say that
we really *are* sorry about the errors in the text, and hope that the
stuff that's right makes up for it. Some of the errors come directly
from the source material (I won't say here whose papers had incorrect
descriptions of the work which was only fixed in subsequent papers, 
but such errors do abound), others are our fault alone. It's also
interesting to see one's own errors propagated to other texts, whose
authors apparently didn't bother to read the original papers themselves. 
It's annoying, however,  to see whole chunks of one's (correct) prose
copied verbatim to other texts without attribution :-(.

  The bibliographic reference is correct, and what the paper
  describes is the implementation of the Sanford-Robertson
  model to one reflection from a surface for infrared signature
  generation (since the bulk of the signature is emission,
  one bounce is a fairly small percentage of the signature,
  and multiple bounces don't add much.)

  Anyway, the ERIM page Pete referred to
  http://www.erim.org/on-line-docs/GUIDE/guide.frm.html
  was prepared by Ken Ellis, who can probably
  answer questions about the source of the
  various equations.  If the email on web page doesn't

  Atlantic Aerospace. He has a recent paper on
  first principle reflectance modeling you might find

Hi all.  I was recently pointed to the web page:

http://www.erim.org/on-line-docs/GUIDE/guide.frm.html

Which has a discussion of several BRDF models.  It has
several small errors, but also some very good information.

I have two questions that arise from it I hope somebody can answer:

1. In Equation 8, the "glossy coating BRDF", there is a specular
   reflectance (surface term) and a subsurface term:

   rho0 [ 1-R(thetai) ] [ 1-R(thetar) ] / (PI n^2)

   where rho0 is the diffuse refectance of the substrate,
   thetai and thetar are angles to the normal, R is the
   surface (Fresnel) term, and n is the refractive index.

   This is very similar to a model I arrived at independently, so
   I want to track the source down.  Anybody know where it is from?


2. A paper by [Rushmeier and Tynor, 90] is alluded to, with
   no title or bibliography entry.  What is it (I have a feeling
   our friend HR can answer this one).


Thanks

Subject: Cloud shading
Status: R

I was just looking out my window at some beautiful clouds, and I think I have
finally figured out why their edges are dark! The clouds were lit by the sun
from the upper right, at 90 degrees to my viewing direction, but their right
hand and upper edges still looked dark when viewed against more distant clouds
of the same white color. If each water droplet scattered or absorbed the same
amount of light in all directions, the color would depend only on the
integrated density of droplets along a viewing ray (column density), and not on
their density distribution along the ray. If anything, one would expect the
sunlit droplets at the edge of a cloud to scatter more light than those inside.

The answer is that they probably do, but at the tenuous edge of the cloud, the
probability of multiple scattering is lower, so that the highly forward
scattering in the water droplets does not undergo enough multiple scattering
for its direction to be randomized. Looking from the side, I saw less than my
share of this forward scattered light, although the extinction (absorption) of
these edge droplets still attenuated the light from behind according to their
column density. When the sun is directly behind a cloud, the edges look much
brighter, due to the forward scattering, so everything balances out.

This was very interesting reading.  From what I know of LVS, most
conclusions sounded pretty reasonable.  I noted that they used LVS
version 1.2.4.  My guess is that version 1.3 (available for well
over a year) would have given more accurate results, at least for
the CUBE test.  Version 2.0 would be better still.  Both of these
versions accurately solve an environment with an analytical solution
(the inside of a cube where each face is a perfect diffuse emitter),
while 1.2.4 (if I recall correctly) failed this test.

In any case, I did find some unexpected conclusions.

1. In APART2 they're surprised by the specular reflection model used
by LVS.  They assume it's incorrect but it is in fact demonstrating
the angular dependence of reflectivity.  Whether the model is
accurate could be the subject of a similar analysis.

2. In the DREAM0 evaluation they state that LVS doesn't have `cone'
lights.  Well of course LVS does have them (it calls them spot lights).

3. Also in DREAM0 they note bleeding of light from the red carpet on
a corner in the cove with the blue carpet.  It shouldn't be there and
they say they can't explain the effect.  It looks like a light leak,
which they should recognize.  I'd be more comfortable with their
conclusions if they clearly stated that it wasn't a light leak and that
the models were constructed to avoid light and shadow leaks.

Still, since the ROOM model is from Lightscape it's safe to assume that
it is so constructed.  And since it fails to match Specter and Radiance,
it's pretty clear that LVS 1.2.4 isn't as accurate as either.

Perhaps it's my bias from having worked at Lightscape, but at a
visceral level I generally find the Lightscape images much more
realistic looking than either the Specter or Radiance images.  Too bad
they're not as accurate.

Many thanks to Chas and the authors for making this known.
Cheers,
-chris

This is very good work (referring to the comparison between Lightscape,
Spectre and Radiance at http://rmp.kiam1.rssi.ru/articles/pals/pals.htm).
Is this going to be a technical report somewhere?  I would like to learn
more about Spectre also.  I have followed this program through its various
name changes, but never actually spoken to someone with a copy of it.  It
sounds like it has come a long way, and is worth a closer look.  Can you
send us a working web address for this product (the link on your report
seems to be broken)?

I was a bit disappointed at the quality of the Radiance renderings you
showed, and I wonder if you used the new "rad" interface to generate
them?  This is an executive script that makes the control of calculation
parameters and image filtering much more automatic and natural, and would
reduce or eliminate many of the artifacts you are seeing, which are the
result of poor parameter choices or (in the case of the aliasing artifacts)
missing the final image filtering pass.

This same program also has a GUI, called trad, which makes running and
controlling the rendering process much easier.

I was very pleased to see the in-depth analysis of the three calculation
methods.  I was particularly intrigued by Spectre's apparent ability to
control the overall simulation accuracy.  Since this quantity is intricately
tied to the geometric modeling and the resolution of the illumination map,
however, I am not sure exactly what is being controlled here.  I notice in
the comparison of absolute error, that Spectre did not seem to have as good
a handle on its calculation as implied by this accuracy parameter.  In my
own research on global illumination, I have found such absolute error bounds
to be extremely elusive.  The work on this by Arvo and others has shown
some promise for error limits at radiosity mesh points, but of course this
says nothing about what's going on between mesh points, and this is for
diffuse-only environments besides.  Monte Carlo methods can offer statistical
error estimates for arbitrary environments, but achieving specific accuracy
tolerances at some pixels is next to impossible using conventional methods.
(I won't scoop Eric Veach, who seems to have found a very promising new
MC technique which I hope will appear in the literature sooner rather than
later.)

There were some other, very minor, errors in your exposition, which I would
be happy to correct if you like.  The main problem in my view was the way
Radiance was used, which had a large effect on the results.  I admit that
it is not at all clear for the new user how to best apply this software,
even if they have an excellent understanding of the underlying algorithms.
I am hoping to remedy this situation with the publication of a book from
Wiley, which will hopefully be available by this Summer.

Please forward this also to Andrei, as I did not find his e-mail address.

Thanks!

Some year and half ago we requested providers of physically accurate

* Shouldn't all members of globillum have been consulted before such a move

Looking through the mailing list of teamcad2 I see that several members of

Dear globillumers,

first of all, a happy new year to all !

Most of you have noticed a very annoying problem with the teamcad and
teamcad2 mailing lists. These lists included the globillum alias, without
having asked the globillum recipients or myself for approval. This was
a simple mishap and the people at Georgia Tech are very sorry.
Now I understand that globillum should have been removed from these lists.

The confusion only grew because so many people responded to the first
teamcad messages and copied their answers to the list!

The second message I want to send to globillumers is that we are
undergoing some technical changes here as globillum has been  moved
to a list server. Apparently everything works fine but it means that
some people who have requested to be on the list have not been added yet.
If you know anybody in this situation... tell them I'll work on it as
soon as possible !

Subject: kd-tree
Status: R

Hi globillumers :)

I am preparing a paper on a new globillum rendering technique and I am 
trying to implement several other methods in my rendering architecture
for comparison and benchmarking.

One of these methods is the photon map. Reading H.W. Jensen's "Global
illumination using photon maps" paper there is a reference to Bentley's
kd-tree M nearest point searching algorithm. Jensen explains that this
algorithm can find the M nearest (euclidean distance) photons to any
given point in a N point set in O(M log2 N) time. Due to the shortage
of CS books in my school I have been unable to find Bentley's paper :(

I have worked out another method creating 3 sorted lists (one for each 
coord.) and doing the following:
  
  -For the first coord. I search for the M closest 1D photons right and
  left from the nearest.

  -For the other coords. I also search right and left from the closest
  1D point in the list and within a constantly updated range given by
  the longest euclidean distance of the M photons found to that point
  to update the M nearest photons list. The longest distance bounds
  the 1D range so that photons outside it must be farther away.

This method is much worse than O(M log2 N) making it almost worthless.
I have been thinking about how it could be performed using a kd-tree but
it seems much more prepared to handle hypercubes than hyperspheres...

I am sorry to put this question on the list as it might sound quite
naive but if any of you could be kind enough to point me the right way
(as in Bentley's), I would be really grateful as I have been thinking
of changing to an octree structure or hanging myself :)

Thanks a lot,

                                Eduardo.

COMPARISON

As You (and apparently LVS) are not satisfied with the way RADIANCE
(LIGHTSCAPE) has been used we are going to repeat the comparison
following your advises and with new software version(3.0 ?). Today we
sent a message to globillum at this topic and welcome others who are
willing to deliver their software for benchmarking. I think it will take
finite time until all information is completed and conditions are agreed
among the interested parties.

You pointed our serious mistake: we refer to RADIANCE 2.5 (and we
actually used it for benchmarks!) while obsolete Reference Manual (for
previous 2.4 version) was used. So, we knew nothing about 'trad'.

What concerns to 'rad' we found it more convenient to call the batch
programs ('oconv', 'rpict', 'ximage') directly as we need sometimes
rather long calculations. Maybe we missed some possibilities offered by
'rad'.

Filtering was not used at all. Apparently we met some problems with its
usage.

Have you seen the paper 
"Comparison of two Methods of Global Illumination Analysis"

at http://rmp.kiam1.rssi.ru/articles/cmgia/monte_carlo.htm ?

Section 3.1 of this paper contains detailed explanation of how accuracy
is controlled in Specter. We'll be very grateful to You for any remarks.
The reason for this request is that some readers find this part unclear.

Yes, we also found that the accuracy control Specter provides is not
always natural for user. Actually, the Specter's accuracy measure is
frequently used in relative manner: we don't know how the value reported
relates to perceptual quality, but we can rely that decreasing of this
value twice will lead to twice as good image.

Hi Andrei,

I am just getting to comment on your web pages, and I'll just write about
what I notice as I go through it (the comparison and validation pages):

In http://rmp.kiam1.rssi.ru/articles/pals/radiance.htm, Section 3.1:

	Note that Radiance has not possibility to specify point or cone light
	sources at all, i.e. when the light starts from abstract point. As an
	approximation to point light in Radiance a small lighting sphere can
	be used.

If by "cone light sources" you mean spotlights, there is a spotlight
material type that can be used to produce light in cones, not that any
such ideal exists in the real world.  As for point sources, the spheres
may be arbitrarily small.

	Radiance has not intelligent sampling of light sources. The
	only case that is handled properly is parallelograms. Light
	sources in form of sphere are not sampled at all in Radiance.
	Other sources are approximately rectangular (ref. to Radiance
	Digest, v2n5.2, 537 line).

This is not entirely accurate.  It is true that parallelograms are the
only sources that are sampled exactly correctly, but the sampling of
most other source shapes is approximately correct.  Spheres are sampled
over a cubic area, which though inaccurate in some sense, does not
result in great inaccuracies in the result, and it is considerably
faster than doing it exactly as a sphere.  I hope you read all of the
Radiance Digest section you reference, as Peter did find out that he
had been making a mistake in his integration, and that Radiance was
actually converging to the correct result.

You mention that the conversion from IES luminaire files is "not
correct."  Again, it is an approximation, as is EVERYTHING in lighting
simulation!  It doesn't help matters to make inflammatory remarks,
especially when you fail to make them for the other packages.  None of
the packages can model the arbitrarily strange shapes included in the
IES specification, and Radiance simply chooses the closest approximating
geometry, which is what the other packages must do, also.

Section 3.2:

Radiance does not "subdivide surfaces into patches."  The algorithm
employed never makes use of any explicit geometric subdivision of any
kind, but relies instead on unorganized point value interpolation.
The octree is used for point lookup, but does not decimate the scene.
This way, values may be shared between surfaces and subsurfaces on an
arbitrary topology, which is a unique feature of the system.

You say that Radiance does not handle semispecular surfaces efficiently,
when in fact it does, at least as efficiently as Specter.  Except for
the user-specified BRDF types, all light interactions are accounted for
in Radiance, and the process proceeds efficiently from the point of
measurement (i.e., the viewpoint) backwards to the light sources.  Ideal
specular surfaces are treated with the special material types you
mention in order to avoid the source-finding problem of light-backwards
ray tracing, and the corresponding shadow accuracy (i-map resolution)
problem of light-forwards ray tracing.

The efficiency enhancements you mention for limiting the cost of the
virtual light source calculation are OPTIONAL.  For people who insist on
accuracy guarantees (which by the way are completely bogus, because
light propogation is a probabilistic process), can change these
parameters to guarantee results.  The runaway creation of virtual
sources is still avoided by geometry checks that are 100% reliable.

Again, I would like to see a change in the summary, since Radiance does
in fact model diffuse-specular interactions fully and correctly.

Section 3.3:

I agree that setting parameters is non-trivial, which is why I wrote the
"rad" program, described in a paper at the 1995 Eurographics Workshop on
Rendering.  In general, direct accuracy controls are unreliable,
but even so, Radiance parameters are tied to accuracy whenever it is
possible or reasonable to do so.

Section 3.4:

You are rightly critical of Radiance 2.5's display mapping function.
The next version of Radiance (3.1) includes a new program called
"pcond," which contains a comprehensive tone mapping operator with
strong ties to human vision.

http://rmp.kiam1.rssi.ru/articles/pals/results.htm, Section 5.1.4:

I thought this section demonstrated very well my point about the
absolute control of accuracy, or lack thereof.  That is to say, even
though you have so-called "accuracy" settings in Specter, they do not in
fact correspond to any kind of accuracy you can measure.  Although absolute
accuracy is a laudable goal, it is not a practical one when it comes to
lighting simulation.  All you can do is trade time for accuracy and
peform convergence tests such as this on specific scenes.  There is no
technique that can guarantee lighting simulation accuracy in arbitrary
environments.  The best we can hope for is a statistical estimate based
on Monte Carlo convergence tests, and such a criterion offers no
guarantee that the process will EVER finish!

Section 5.2:

The Radiance rendering exhibits significant aliasing because the final
(pfilt) pass was not made.  This is an error in the way the rendering
was performed that affects the appearance, but not the accuracy of the
pixel values.  The accuracy of the shadows is a function of the -dj
as well as the -ds parameter, which should be controlled by the "rad"
program I mentioned before.

Section 5.3:

Again, the complaint about Radiance images showing jaggies is the result
of failing to filter the result properly with pfilt.  This can be
remedied by applying the "rad" program, which runs it automatically.

For some reason, you did not include the time for Radiance rendering of
the flower scene.  In the bathroom (CG) scene, you say that Specter
computed the image an "order of magnitude" (10 times) faster than
Radiance, when your table shows times of 4.1 and 3 hours for the two
systems, with Radiance being the faster.  Something is wrong, here.

In the final office scene (very nice, by the way), the rendering
parameters obviously require adjustment.  Once again, the "rad" program
makes this process very intuitive, and I strongly suggest you use it.
It also has a single "accuracy" control called "QUALITY", but does not
attempt to tie this to numerical accuracy, which cannot be guaranteed,
as we have witnessed from the Specter results.

http://rmp.kiam1.rssi.ru/articles/pals/conclusion.htm, Section 6:

In general, I agreed with your conclusions, despite my earlier remarks.

Overall, I think you have provided the global illumination community
a tremendous service, and we owe you a debt of gratitude.  I hope that
your analysis has a great influence on any future validation and
comparison work, as a standard of excellence for others to match!

P.S. to my previous comments.  I forgot to mention that the latest version
of Radiance (3.0) also has participating media, and can therefore simulate
the same effects that Specter seems to.  I do not know enough about Specter
to comment on the accuracy of its model, but Radiance does apply a fairly
rigorous PM model, with typical optimizations to minimize rendering time.
These optimizations do require a degree of user control, however.

Hello, Greg,

Thank you for detailed analysis of our comparison study. It seems that
we really failed to use some important features of Radiance. Here I

There is a technical error in our text: one column was lost in the

I downloaded this file and examined it today. I had no problem in

release)

We tried GSVIEW32.EXE Version 2.0 1996-08-11 on Win95 and GSVIEW32.EXE
Version 2.1 1996-11-04 on WinNT. All with the same effect. Being printed
(we have to print it via GSView) it looks the same: the interline
spacing is so little that 3 or more consecutive lines are overlapped. We
never faced this problem with other PS docs. Say, the article "Making
Global Illumination User-Friendly"
(radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/erw95.1/papers.ps.Z) looks quite well.

The problem is, however, not urgent now as we can use HTML version of
MGFDOC.

Hi,


Re: "An Inexpensive BRDF Model for Physically Based Rendering"
    C. Schlick EuroGraphics 94 VVol 13 number 3


I've been working my way through the above paper, and have come unstuck
in several places. Any suggestions will be much appreciated.


________________________________________________________________________
Eqn 30.  First imagine the terms without the normalisation factor,   
4Pi, so it becomes:

D(t,v,v',w) =  G(v) G(v') Z(t) A(w) + ( 1 - G(v) G(v') )
               __________               ______________
                  v v'                       v v'

First I think this should actually be:

D(t,v,v',w) =  G(v) G(v') Z(t) A(w) + ( 1 - G(v) G(v') )
               __________                   __________
                  v v'                          v v'

Surely this means that ALL the directional diffuse would be reemitted
along v'.  Shouldn't the ( 1 - G(v)G(v')/vv') be divided by 2Pi so that
it is equally distributed over the hemisphere?
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________

- Eqn 32


D(t,v,v',w) = a  +  b  B(t,v,v',w) + c  Dirac-delta
              __    ______________   ______________
              Pi       4 Pi v v'       v' dV'

a,b,c are weighting coefficients.

Shouldn't this be

D(t,v,v',w) = a Diffuse_refl  +  b  B(t,v,v',w) + c  Fresnel Dirac-delta
              ______________     ______________   ______________________
                   Pi                  Pi               v' dV'

B(t,v,v',w) is the previous D(t,v,v',w).
First put the reflectance coefficients in, remove the unecessary vv'.
Why was there a factor of 4 on the denominator, if Int[Z(t)A(w)] = Pi
over the hemisphere for perfectly smooth isotropic reflectors?

Found this dusty message just now; I didn't answer because, frankly,
I've never convinced anyone here that better visual simulations,
reflectance functions, reflectance measurements, etc, are
needed. Sorry.

Actually, you might contact someone in the Advanced Lighting
Technology Group about this; they have at least played with optical
simulations of the down-the-road view at night, and hired ERIM for a
while to code something up for them. When I visited (a year ago? two
years ago?), they said, "there's this parameter called 'gamma' in the
program, and you can make the picture look bright or dark with it. Any
idea what it does?" Sigh.

I talked to Mahendra Dassanayake (mdassana@ford.com) and Balvant Patel
(bpatel6@ford.com). You probably have run into the tendency of
numerical simulation analysts to be from India :).

Subject: FORM FACTORS COMPUTATION THROUGH SGI HARDWARE
Date: Fri, 28 Feb 97 12:12:08 +0100
Status: RO

Hello everybody,

I have some questions that concern Hardware Acceleration for Form Factor 
Computation. So I tried all what is possible to compute off-screen(and 
'on-screen') form factors using OpenGL. The problem is that the computation 
time I obtained is really BAD ! 
So does anybody have any information about programming off-screen rendering to 
EFFECTIVELY accelerate the computation time for form factors using the SGI 
hardware?

You can find next all the solutions I tried:

- OpenInventor SoOffScreenRender Class: computation time is incredibly slow: 
it is unusable.

- GLXPixmaps with X11 Pixmaps: the computation time is DRAMATICALLY slow, 
therefore it is unusable too. 99.99 % computation time is in the 
GLReadPixels() OpenGL Command (?!?!?)

- PBuffers on a Maximum Impact  R10000 (195Mhz). The computation time is 
the following: 15.6sec to compute 300x300 resolution 2000 Z-Buffers with a 70 
patches scene (then 140000 projections). For me, it is really unacceptable: 
MaxImpact has at least a 1.5Million polygons/second rendering capacity with 
Gouraud shading(there is probably no glReadPixels() call). In any case, I 
am only using Flat Shading and one light source, and this gives us a 10000 
polygon/sec rendering capacity (!?!!): we had better computation time using 
Mesa Library(14.89 sec) to render this small scene on the same machine ! 

In my opinion, there are several problem levels:
- Does PBuffers really use Hardware ? It doesn't seem to be the case since, 
using osview, we can see that Hardware lines(gfxc, gfxf...) gives 0.00% (?!?). 
So, if it doesn't use Hardware, why computation time is faster than using X 
Pixmaps(as PBuffers are Pixmaps Hardware) ?

- There is a SGI paper on using hardware for radiosity: "Real Time Radiosity 
Through Parallel Processing and Hardware Acceleration", by D.R. Baum and J.M. 
Winget, Computer Graphics 1990(Symposium on Interactive 3D graphics) p67-75.
Page 69: "Once the five hemi-cube are generated(top of hemi-cube and four 
sides), they are read back from frame buffer memory to host shared memory for 
processing". This paper is 7 years old and - in spite of the fact they were 
using multi-processing - they obtained results that I consider impossible to 
have today on a Maximum Impact R10k 195mhz ! I suspect that it is due to the 
fact that this technique was performed using GL Library, and we moved to 
OpenGL that is really slower.

To finish with this very long mail:
HOW TO USE HARDWARE WITH OFF-SCREEN RENDERING ?!?!? I don't want to open any 
window ! I just want to use Hardware, compute Z-Buffers(FLAT) and get the 
result images in real time: is it possible for a Max Impact to compute a 
300x300 Z-Buffer of a 400000 patches scene and to get the result image in less 
than 1 sec ?

No, I suspect that the phrase I highlighted above is the key; SGI
machines are generally highly optimized to render to the screen. I
would not be at all surprised if off-screen rendering were much slower
on most SGI machines.

Maybe you are stuck with using the screen, then reading back the frame
buffer.

I would suggest a post to USENET group comp.sys.sgi.graphics; there
are several SGI engineers who hang out there and give you the *real*
answer.

If you can find a copy of:

You are right: off-screen rendering is generally slower than "on-screen" 
rendering(but it depends on the technique you chose). 
But if you use the glReadPixels() function in your "render to screen" program, 
then you have quite similar computation time to these obtained with off-screen 
rendering.

I already sent a message in the OpenGL usenet, and nobody answered me, or just 
with "did you read the faqs ?" ...
So, I will send a message to comp.sys.sgi.graphics too. But I already sent 
several mails to SGI HOT-LINE in France and USA. They didn't arrive to resolve 
my problem. In France and in USA, there is still an opened phone-line on my 
problem(ref FR62888). I am still waiting about a solution.

Both of these do the same thing (render to pixmaps).  They make an indirect
rendering context, which sends all OpenGL commands through the X server.
As you've discovered, that's slow.  But read on to see the real problem.

You're not going to get anywhere near the top polygon rendering
performance of the Max Impact with a 70 polygon scene.  Think about it.
You clear the 300x300 buffer, render 70 polygons, then read the pixels.
The time it takes to render 70 polygons is miniscule compared to the time
it takes to clear and read 90000 pixels.  Try rendering 7000 polygons and
see what happens to your `polygon' performance.

The problem here was your measurement of performance.  When you read 1.5M
polygons/sec from the marketing brochures it means 1.5M polygons per
second, not 1.5M polygons per second including reading and clearing the
screen every 70 polygons.  Are the marketing numbers misleading?  No,
they say exactly what they mean.

Some suggestions for increasing performance.  Use as large a buffer as
you can make that's a multiple of 300x300.  Clear the entire buffer,
render your scene into each 300x300 subregion, then read the entire buffer
in one call.  That'll amortize the overhead of each clear and pixel read.

If you're in a closed environment then every pixel in each 300x300 region
will be written to.  See the first issue of the Journal of Graphics Tools
for a simple technique to avoid the screen clear completely.

Make sure you're using a direct rendering context (the last parameter to
glXCreateContext should be True).

What's the light source for?  Turn it off if you don't really need it.

In any case, the pixel read will remain the bottleneck.

Yes, if you use a direct rendering context.

Definitely not.  That'd be a brilliant move for SGI, ``with OpenGL get the
graphics performance of 5 years ago, TODAY!''  It might well be due to the
author's in-depth knowledge of the platform and the bottlenecks in rendering.

Pixmap rendering is all done in software, so it should be slow.  I imagine
the Inventor class uses Pixmaps.  pBuffers are the way to go on a RE, but
on an Impact I wouldn't be surprised if they were in software.  I don't
think the framebuffer on the Impact has many spare bits. 

The backbuffer should be a good option in double-buffered mode on any SGI
hardware, though some machines will draw in dithered 16-bit mode, so be
careful about how much you trust that.

glReadPixels always goes through host memory, so you're bound by the
memory bandwidth there.  I think the Impact gives you a generous 200
MB/sec, but even so it's not pretty.  For an Impact, drawing 70 polygons
is trivial, so you can consider your test a benchmark of glReadPixels. 

In answer to your question: you can certainly create a 300x300 image of a
400,000-patch scene in a backbuffer in < 1 second on this hardware.  At
this point you won't be depending on host memory for your throughput, and
the hardware will be able to scream through rendering polygons.

Again, maybe pbuffers will work in single-buffered mode on the Impact, but
I don't know about this.

In the broader scope, I think that hemicube radiosity really presents some
architectural problems for all but the latest of graphics hardware. 
There's a huge overhead for using the bus between the hardware and the
host CPU, but the constant "ping-ponging" back and forth means that
efficient systems are hard to build.  The newer SGI machines (O2 and
Onyx2) have UMA (unified memory architecture), so the bus is not
nearly as much of a bottleneck.

As a point of reference, can someone post some empirical speed results
from ray-casting (using appropriate subdivision) into "typical" scenes of
a variety of sizes?  I imagine that at the 70-patch level, software would
be faster, and at the 400,000-patch level, hardware would win.  But an
approximate intersection point would be nice to have.

Chris has made some excellent suggestions below.  Additionally, if you
overlap the remainder of the host based form-factor computation with the
hemicube visiblity calculations you are performing on the hardware you
will see additional time savings.

A couple of comments on the above.  First, with a scene of interesting
complexity (minimum of several thousand polys rendered 5 times for each
face of the cube), read back overhead shouldn't be that bad.  Again,if you've
got an MP machine think about overlapping your computations.  Also, the Onyx2
is not what I would call a UMA architecture.   We officially term is as SSMP,
but you might want to think of it as NUMA (non-uniform memory access) in that
there isn't a common system bus inbetween CPU and main memory.  Main memory
is distributed throughout the system with different access times depending
on the location of memory.  Obviously, the system tries to be intelligent
to keep your data as close to the processor that operating on it.

You are right, but I knew that. So, it's my fault, I fear that I haven't been 
clear about my real problem. In fact, I spent several weeks to try each method 
about off-screen rendering and I spent several hours with SGI Hot-Line to 
understand the reasons of the bad performances I obtained. In fact, in my 
opinion, for GLXPixmaps, there is nothing to do, because of the same reasons 
you invoked. For Pbuffers(the last solution ?), I have the sensation it could 
be a good solution if you have a Infinite Reality or a Reality Monster. On a 
Maximum Impact, it is too slow. Maybe there is another idea: isn't it possible 
to put a (ubyte *) pointer to the memory area where pixels are stored ? I 
think It would be really faster than using glReadPixels() function, no ?

Again, you are right. But if I have a 7000 polygon scene, I will approximately 
read 35000 buffers to compute form factors, then I think it will be really 
slow, since it takes a lot of time to do a single "glReadPixels()" call.

You are right again and that's what I said in my previous mail: ther is no 
read 
buffer in their performance measurements. But, 1.5 Million polygon per second 
doesn't mean anything for me. Indeed, when we read their performance 
announcements, you can't find: Buffer resolution(50x50 or 1000x1000 ?), 
percentage of bitmap occupation(10% or 90% ?), and -and it is really 
important- polygons configuration (I mean if they project the scene in a 
special order(sorted polygons), they can really accelerate the computation 
time). But that is not the real problem here. So if the numbers are not really 
exact, I don't think they are completely false. 
What I really would like to know is: what is done in glReadPixels() ? If you 
read the OpenGL Faqs, you can see that disabling fog, texture... accelerate 
the reading command execution ! WHY ?!?! For me reading the frame buffer is 
only a problem of getting memory address ! It has been stored somewhere, and I 
only what to get a pointer on this memory area ! There is nothing to compute !

OK, thank you for the information. I will apply this idea.

Sure it is ! Otherwise, I can't use Hardware.

Sorry, I made a mistake. I didn't define any light source. And they are 
disabled before reading the buffer because it seems to accelerate the reading 
command !?!?!

> Yes, if you use a direct rendering context.

Sorry, I can't be agree. It is not the case on a Maximum Impact: I made a lot 
of tests, and each time the graphics card is not sollicited. And if you ask to 
SGI, they say you that Pbuffers uses Hardware on high/max Impact, RE2, IR and 
O2. So, I sent my code to SGI, and they try it on Maximum Impact and O2, and 
they saw that there is no Hardware use ! So they open a phone-line(FR-62888) 
about that problem... I am still waiting for an answer.

Maybe. But, if you make some tests with pure GL read command and if you 
compare it to the same OpenGL command, you obtain very big differences ! The 
GL read command is several times faster than the OpenGL one !!

First, there is no such thing as a memory-mapped framebuffer on an SGI. 
This is part of the design spec.  Everything is done through library
calls, so when you call glReadPixels() the framebuffer is copied into a
buffer in your program's address space.  So you can't just assign a
pointer and read.

However, you should be able to get better rates on glReadPixels.  I think
that on the machines you're using GL_RGB (GL_ABGR_EXT on older machines)
with GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE is a fast path.  If, instead of bytes, you're
reading into floats, the conversion is likely done in software, and you'll
pay very dearly for it.  Using these parameters, you should get speed
equivalent to the IRIS-GL command.

Try doing repeated glReadPixels from an on-screen region, using the same
call you are using now.  Measure the throughput in MB/sec.  On the worst
of SGI machines, I think you should get better than ~30 MB/sec.  It's
probably much better on the machines you're talking about. 

I would guess that your system profile isn't indicating the drawing time,
since it's so little work for the hardware.  As I remember, glReadPixels
will show up as "user time" in gr_osview.

Just a minute here. What pixel format are you using in the readback?
If you're reading pixels that must be repacked after reading from the
frame buffer, there will be sicgnificant overhead. I suspect that
defaults may well be different from IRIS/GL and OpenGL. I also would
expect that the optimum pixel format would vary with hardware type.

Generally, OpenGL should run faster than IRIS/GL on the Impact series,
as that's its native mode. Older graphics adapters, like IMPACT, would
probably be faster with IRIS/GL.

I think posting the kernel of your readback code would be useful; I
bet Chris can help speed it up.

Hi Samuel:

	As has been pointed out by others, there is no way to access the
framebuffer directly.  It must be copied back using glReadPixels.  Now the
performance for glReadPixels depends on the machine you are running on and
the amount of data you are reading back.  There is overhead to setup the
read transfer regardless of the number of pixels you are going to read back.

So, to get maximum performance you have to treat this as a systems problem
and tune to get maximum performance for your system.  For example, try
rendering several hemi-cubes into the framebuffer and then read them all
back with a single glReadPixels().  On a Max Impact, glReadPixels() should
be just as fast as IrisGL based pixel read unless you are using some odd
conversion (I would assume you are reading the hemi-cube pixels back as
unsigned integers). BTW, I'm not nearly as familiar with the Impact
architecture
and performance characteristics as I am with our high end machines.

This is one of the commonest complaints (usually its a complaint about the
speed of writing pixels) when moving from GL to OpenGL. It is also a
misconception.

OpenGL has far more state information relating to pixel data and formats than
GL had. The problem is that most people don't set the correct values for the
operation they wish to perform. In OpenGL this will result in poor performance.
I just looked for my piece of code to demonstrate this but its mysteriously
vanished :-(.

The one caveat is if you are running on old hardware some commands are faster
in GL than OpenGL.

Chris.

Well yes and no. The O2 does have a memory mapped frame buffer in one sense -
the obvious sense :-). So technically it is possible to look into memory and
see whats on the screen using a pointer and some jiggery pokery. Its the second
part that worries me. I believe the exact way in which the frame buffer is
organised in memory is documented *but* the documentation says that SGI reserve
the right to alter it at any time. Therefore the only safe way to code is to do
as suggested above and access through digital media libraries or opengl. You
could peek and poke memory, I wouldn't advise it. However, this is irrelevant
as the speed of reading the framebuffer is very fast through opengl as all that
is really going on is a memcopy.

Hi globillumers--

Since the SIGGRAPH sketch chair, David Ebert, has been in
high gear for publicity, you probably have already received
e-mail about the sketches program. However one thing that you
might have missed is that each accepted Sketch this year
receives Conference Access registration."Conferences Access"
means admission to essentially everything -- Courses,
Papers, Panels, etc. You would have to pay for printed
proceedings and CD-ROMS, (and you still have to
pay to get yourself to Los Angeles and stay some

your choice for free is a pretty good deal. Both
technical contributions and applications can be

Dear Globillum'ers,
  I've recently run into a seemingly difficult terminology question about
what to call the quantities that we actually compute or attempt to compute
in global illumination.  We often refer to our results as radiance or
radiant exitance, but what we actually compute and store does not
correspond the definitions of these terms as given the IES/ANSI standard
for illuminating engineering terminology.
  That terminology seems to fall into three categories: spectral radiometry,
radiometry, and photometry.  Spectral radiometric functions (e.g. spectral
radiance) give the amount of light as a function of wavelength.  They contain
the most information and the others are derived from them by various
wavelength weighting functions.  Radiometric functions (e.g. radiance)
weight power at all wavelengths equally and thus measure total 
power.  Photometric functions (e.g. luminance) weight the light power by
the human luminance response curve and measure human grayscale response.
  Radiometric functions are fine for heat transfer applications that are
concerned about the flow of heat energy.  Photometric functions are fine
for grayscale image making.  However as far as I can tell, there doesn't 
seem to be any standard terminology for the quantities needed to make 
color images.  The usual standard for color response is the CIE 1931
Standard Colormetric Observer which defines colors by three values, XYZ 
which can be found by using three standard wavelength weighting functions.  
We compute a color image by weighting the spectral radiance by these
three response functions.  The Y response curve is the luminous response
curve and thus is luminance.  However there doesn't seem to be a name for
X and Z channel results.  Together the XYZ values are sometimes refered to 
as the tristimulus values, so it would seem correct to call our results
the "tristimulus values of the spectral radiance".  However that seems 
rather cumbersome, and it would be nicer to have a name for quantities
which we actually compute and store.
  I'd like to propose a new set of terminology for "color photometry".
Analogous to radiometry and photometry, it would give names for the
spectral radiometric functions when weighted by the CIE XYZ response curves.
The proposed corresponding terms are: 

Radiometry           Photometry          Color Photometry
---------------------------------------------------------
radiance             luminance           tristimulance
irradiance           illuminance         intristimulance
radiant exitance     luminous exitance   tristimulus exitance

  I'd like to hear people's reactions.  Do names for these quantities
already exist? Are there better names?  Do we need names for these 
quantities?  It seems a little sloppy to keep refering to our results
as the radiance when at best we really mean the spectral radiance and in
practice we really mean what I'm calling the tristimulance.


Bruce Walter
Cornell Program of Computer Graphics

p.s. Tristimulus values do not necessarily refer to the CIE 1931 XYZ
values.  It is also used in the literature to refer to values generated
by other three channel color models.  So we would need to be careful to
specify which color model we are using when we want to be precise.

p.p.s. I wanted to call it the chrominance, but this term is already in
use and often means the portion of the color which is "orthogonal" to the
luminance.  Using tristimulance instead avoids this confusion.

  At the risk of beating a dead horse, I'll post a update to my terminology
posting of a week ago.  I've received a few replies but all off list.  So 
far my terminology proposal has been greeted with a collective yawn.  This 
is not surprising as terminology issues are like credit card bills.  Not 
very exciting but you will end up in big trouble if you don't deal with them.
Even I am not all that thrilled by my proposed "tristimulance" terminology,
and I'd be happy to endorse a better suggestion if one is put forward.
But I think that there is something unsatisfactory about our current use
of terminology and specifically the term "radiance".
  If we accept the ANSI/IES illuminating engineering terminology standard,
then the term radiance has a precise definition, and it precisely describes 
a quantity which is useless for computer graphics.  It measures radiated 
power regardless of its wavelength.  If I'm warming my feet by a roaring 
fire, radiance is useful for telling me how close I can get before my socks 
are in danger of catching on fire, but it does not describe what I will 
actually see with my eyes.
  The current usage often seems be (and I too am guilty of this):  "I'll 
say 'radiance' (since I'm used to the term and others use it too) because 
its obvious that I don't actually mean 'radiance' (as defined in the ANSI/IES
standard) and therefore my audience will figure out what I actually mean 
(even if I'm not sure myself)".  If we want to continue using the term 
radiance we should really decide what we mean by it.  It is fine for 
describing monochromatic light, but that's only useful for some pedagogical 
purposes.  We could claim that it is a shorthand for the spectral radiance, 
but we should recognize that that is an implicit redefinition of the term 
radiance.  Also we aren't really after spectral radiance.  I don't know 
anyone who actually stores a spectra at each of their pixels (at least not 
in computer graphics).  And we don't bother to compute the spectral radiance 
outside of the visible band, not because its not significant, but because 
it doesn't affect what really are interested in.  So what is it that we 
are really interested in computing and what should we call it?  
  This may all seem like hair splitting, but what is the point of having 
precisely defined terms unless we use them precisely?  So I would challenge 
people to either specify what it is they actually mean when they say 
radiance, or to find some alternate terminology to use instead.
  Let me quickly respond to a few comments that I received:

- CIE and IES standards committees are very slow moving bodies, do not
coordinate with each other, and are not necessarily receptive to outside
suggestions.  Thus the chance of affecting the official standards is slim.
> I believe the graphics community should follow standards where they exist
and are applicable, but we also have the right to define our own terminology
where no appropiate standard exists.

- Is the "tri" in tristimulance really necessary, what if you are using 
a different number of weighting functions.  How about stimulance instead?
> The tristimulance terminology is specifically intended for color vision
in the phototopic range where the three color channel approximation is 
nearly universal.  It is also intended to be derivative the somewhat 
standard terminology "tristimulus values".  Other quantities might be 
termed stimulance, though there would be some objections if these quantities
did not correspond to actual stimuli.

- Why not just call it the "color of the radiance"?
> Radiance by definition does not contain the color information.  It would
be at least as correct (and I would argue probably more correct) to call 
it the "color of the luminance".  In my opinion, neither one is really 
satisfactory or terribly precise.

ANNOUNCE: 97/04/01 Release of RADBIB97.BIB
------------------------------------------
RADBIB97 is a comprehensive bibliography of radiosity and
related global illumination papers, theses, articles, and
books. It currently includes 1,106 references.

This bibliography is available in BibTex format as
RADBIB97.BIB (with a release date of April 1, 1997) from:

  http://www.ledalite.com/library-/rrt.htm

and as compressed RadBib97.Z from:

  ftp://hobbes.lbl.gov/pub/doc

As always, it is time-consuming and sometimes difficult to
track down conference papers and theses on radiosity and global
illumination. If you know of a relevant reference that is not
included in the bibliography, please let me know so that I can
include it in the next release.

I just wanted to announce that a technical report on our investigation of
the various radiosity algorithms out there is available on the web at:
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~radiosity/emprad-tr.html

The abstract is reproduced below:

---
An Empirical Comparison of Radiosity Algorithms
Andrew J. Willmott and Paul S. Heckbert

This report presents an extensive empirical comparison of matrix,
progressive, and wavelet radiosity algorithms for simulating diffuse
interreflection in three-dimensional scenes. The algorithms are tested in
their basic forms, without advanced variations such as clustering,
discontinuity meshing, or Monte Carlo techniques. The three algorithms were
implemented in a common code base to facilitate direct empirical
comparison. A number of parameterized scenes were designed to test the
basic methods' ability to deal with such issues as singularities,
occlusion, high reflectance, and scene complexity. Each algorithm was run
on the set of scenes at several parameter settings, and results were
examined in terms of their error, speed, and memory consumption.

For the basic algorithms as we implemented them, our results show:
Progressive radiosity with substructuring is best for simple scenes, but
for moderately complex scenes it is outperformed by wavelet radiosity using
the Haar basis. Wavelet methods use an immense amount of memory; without
clustering they become totally impractical for complex scenes. The problem
is particularly severe for higher order bases, less so for Haar. Visibility
handling was also found to be a critical problem with higher order
wavelets.

This study also provides a general framework for comparisons of global
illumination techniques.

I find patents very hard to read and I probably misinterpret
them.  There are a lot of alarming sounding patents.
Since IBM is big on patenting, there is a patent search web page from IBM
for searching on text etc.  if you want to find more.

http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/

Besides locating the patent, you can read the full
text from gif images of the actual patent, or
just get ascii text of all the claims. The patent Ian mentioned seems
from my naive point of view to be impossible to defend --
they describe a lot of well-known stuff like a simple
adaptive subdivision scheme for meshing.

Another odd  example is, 5590062 "Simulator for producing various
living environments mainly for visual perception"  seems to patent VR
for looking at realistic 3D environments. I like the part on page 41
that says "The 3-D space is not limited to the internal space ... a
plain in the Mesozoic era where dinosaurs exist can be simulated just
for fun." I suppose there is a good legal reason for saying something
like this. I also suppose there is a reason they reference Chernoff's
paper on multivariate visualization with faces.

Then there  is 4928250 "System for deriving radiation images" (aka the
hemicube patent) and the 16 patents that reference it including the
hierarchical z-buffer and something called "Image Processing Apparatus"
that has to do with ray casting in radiosity calculations. Three
patents reference the patent on ray casting for view factors including
5546327 "Apparatus for calculating geometrical view factor", just
issued last August which seems to patent using a hemisphere instead of
the hemicube.  Following various links also leads to 5619627
"Multiple-level occulting using a mask buffer" that describes an
"Occulting apparatus" which just seems to be a method for finding
hidden surfaces fast, not as mysterious an apparatus as you might
think.

I was surprised to find 5363477 "Method for displaying an image of an
object surface using a luminance transformationin accordance with a
non-linear characteristic" that sounds like a patent on the notion of
tone mapping for synthetic images.

You can also search by assignee, for example to see all of Pixar's
patents, e.g. 5239624 "Pseudo-random point sampling techniques in
computer graphics".

Anyway, if you get depressed over this , try the "Gallery of Obscure
Patents" at http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/gallery.html which includes
"Wacky Patent of the Month." On the other hand, the fact that some one
was able to patent a hat that looks like a fried egg might depress you
even more.

Thank's for the URL. Bookmarked.

I'm sure many of you are familiar with the Electronic Frontier Foundation
page on intellectual property:

http://www.eff.org/pub/Intellectual_property/

Useful for some legal insight on software law. Not sure how biased
it is though.

Maybe they're hoping to capitalise on it in the same way E-Data has
been with patent 4528643, which claims rights to all methods of
electronic multimedia distribution. In this case the patent predates
the now "well known" nature of WWW.

( See http://www.lpf.org/Patents/edata.html for the anti-software-patent
point of view of the case)


If worse comes to worse perhaps the Net will treat enforced software
patents as damage and route around them.  (to misquote John Gillmore)
This was certainly a major motivating factor behind the PNG standard
as a GIF replacement.

I can see it now. Huge Monte Carlo rendering farms being set up in the
Caribbean (or other legal havens) servicing contracts from US based
companies.

Subject: read comparison before St Etienne?
Status: R

If you are coming to the Eurographics Workshop on Rendering in
St Etienne, France next week (see http://www.emse.fr/RENDERING97/)
then I would like to suggest that you read a tech report

    "An Empirical Comparison of Radiosity Algorithms"
    http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~radiosity/emprad-tr.html 

as my co-author and I would enjoy getting feedback on this work at the
workshop, and we feel it could be an interesting topic of discussion
there.

Some of our conclusions:

   * Wavelet radiosity without clustering and matrix radiosity are memory hogs.
	(esp. matrix radiosity and higher order wavelets; HR not so bad)
	This was previously known; our results show how bad they are.

   * Visibility handling in wavelet radiosity algorithms is poor,
	consequently higher order wavelets are not currently practical.

   * Progressive radiosity with substructuring is often a better choice
	than wavelet radiosity.

One of our most common excuses for using the simplistic RGB
color model in global illumination-based rendering is that
"there are no spectroradiometric data for commonly available
materials."

This has undoubtably been true in the past, but this excuse
is beginning to wear thin. If you are looking for such data,
try:

- Ian Ashdown

P.S. - I'm sure they are many more sites out there with
equally useful data. I only found this particular one because
I was (am still am) looking for an algorithm to convert DIN
RAL codes to their equivalent Munsell values. Any suggestions
on where to look for this information (short of actually
the DIN standards ;+) would be much appreciated.

--MimeMultipartBoundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi,

I just wanted to announce that an interactive web-based
volume renderer can now be tested. The program is written
as an applet, that runs inside Web pages.
The concept behind this software is a hierarchical (wavelet-based)
representation of the volume data-set. The data is rendered directly
from wavelet-space and thus requires a minumum of memory. The applet
presents a novel way of presenting volumetric data on the Internet.
The user can manipulate an inferior quality version of 3-D volume
interactively in order to set up the viewing parameters, and when they
are correct the image refines progressively.  The rendering perfomance
depends on the network bandwidth and the available hardware platform.

Simply point your internet browser to:
http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/lippert/EVOLVE/

Please feel free to contact me with comments, suggestions, or
bug-reports. I only ran the program on my Indy and PC , but
one of the nice feature of Java is that it runs on all architectures.
If this is not the case, please let me know.


Lars

Subject: Supercomputer and Earth as enclosed Environment
Status: RO

Hi all,

Assuming that we have UNLIMITED computation power machine, does it make
sense to take Earth as the hemisphere, and thus an enclosed environment? 
Or the solar system as a closed environment?

Based on Raditive Heat Transfer techniques (Siegel, 1992), it seems 
possible.

Subject: reflectance model visualizer
Status: RO

A reflectance model visualizer is available in SGI executable form and
C++ source code form at

	http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/src/illum/

The program should be portable to other machines that support the Xforms
user interface library and X windows without too much difficulty.

This program is a fairly general viewer for bidirectional reflectance
distribution functions (BRDF's).  It was written by some students and
myself in a graduate course in global illumination that I taught in
Fall 1996.

The program implements the following reflectance models:
    Phong
    Cook-Torrance
    Oren-Nayar
    He et al.

I demonstrated the program at the Eurographics Workshop on Rendering
in St. Etienne, France last week, and there was enough interest that
I decided to release it more generally.

enjoy!

Hello, my name is Phillip Larsen and I am a MSc student at the University
of Bristol, England.
I am writing my dissertation on radiosity and need to get hold of a
radiosity package which I can build on for my dissertation.

The system configuration I will be running the program on is a Sun
workstation with the Solaris operating system.
If anyon knows where I can get hold of a freeware/shareware radiosity
package with accompanying sourcecode I would really appreciate it if you
would send me a line saying how and where I could find it.

Thankyou for taking the time to read this message.

Yours sincerely
Phillip Andre' Larsen

Last week at the Eurographics Rendering Workshop in St-Stienne,
France, I gave a demo of the photorealistic renderer called "RenderPark",
we are developping in the context of our research here in Leuven (Belgium). 
The renderer currently offers:

- Galerkin radiosity (both gathering and shooting) with (or without) 
  hierarchical refinement, higher order approximations, clustering, 
  view-importance, ...
- stochastic ray radiosity
- ray-casting, classic and stochastic ray-tracing

It is known to compile and run fine on a SUN Sparcstation (with LEO graphics 
hardware and the Nth Protable GL), under Linux (with Mesa, a free OpenGL
like graphics library) and on a number of SGI machines (with OpenGL).

You can retrieve the source code and example scene files
(MGF format) from the URL:

http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/cwis/research/graphics/RENDERPARK/

You can build on it for your research too if you like (hooks are provided
already for your ultimate rendering algorithm).

Best regards,

Philippe.

Subject: Siggraph gathering
Status: R

Dear Siggraph-bound Globillumers:

Each year at Siggraph, we try to get together to discuss common issues and
share ideas.  This year, I'd like to suggest we plan in advance so that
we have the best chance of squeezing a meeting into what is always an
overcrowded week.  I would therefore like to suggest the following time
for our get together:

	Thursday, August 7th, 1-2pm, location TBA

We'll probably end up in one of the Birds-of-a-Feather rooms like we did
the last two years, and there is always a board near the registration or
merchandise pick-up areas where BOF gatherings are posted.  This is where
we will post the final meeting location and verify the time.  If anyone
has a compelling reason why this is a poor choice of time (e.g., it conflicts
with Microsoft's announcement that they will be purchasing Sony and relocating
Japan next to Puget Sound), please let me know.

To get the ball rolling, we will have a special guest from the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (formerly NBS), Dr. Fern Hunt, who
will give an informal overview of a NIST project to standardize reflectance
measurements and models for use in computer graphics and paint manufacturing.
Of particular interest is a new database called NEF, recently declassified
by the CIA, which contains a wealth of data on the reflectance properties
(including spectral and directional BRDFs) for common exterior materials.
NIST is coordinating the dissemination of this information, with help from
a number of people in the industry.

For more information on the NIST appearance project, look up:

	http://math.nist.gov/mcsd/Staff/RLipman/appearance/

Hope to see you there!
-Greg

Regarding the earlier proposal to hold the Siggraph '97 Globillum meeting
on Thursday at 1pm, Paul Heckbert wrote suggesting that we move up the time
so he doesn't have to miss his student's presentation at the 2 o'clock session.
Therefore, I'm recommending that those who can convene at:

	Thursday, August 7th, at 12:30pm, location TBA

We'll reserve one of the birds-of-a-feather rooms and mark the time and place
on the BOF board that is usually situated near the materials pick-up.  Feel
free to grab a bite to eat and bring it with you.  In years past, we've
tried to pick up food for everyone, but usually that's a fiasco, so you're
on your own this year.

We probably won't get serious until 1 o'clock still, so if you can't make it
at 12:30, just come when you can.

Hope to see you there!
-Greg

Papers on global illumination are beginning to appear in some decidedly
non-traditional journals. The following two papers (one accepted for
publication, the other submitted) may be of interest to some of you:

  Atkinson, K., and D. Chen. 1997. "A Fast Matrix-Vector Multiplication
  Method for Solving the Radiosity Equation." Submitted for publication.

  Atkinson, K., and G. Chandler. 1997. "The Collocation Method for Solving
  the Radiosity Equation for Unoccluded Surfaces." To appear in Journal of
  Integral Equations & Applications."

Both papers are available in Postscript format from Kendall Atkinson's
home page at:

  http://www.math.uiowa.edu/~atkinson/papers.html

For those of you who have thoroughly researched the literature, you may
recognize Dr. Kendall as the author of the 1976 book, "A Survey of
Numerical Methods for the Solution of Fredholm Intergral Equations of the
Second Kind." The above two papers are no less rigorous in their treatment
of the subject.

ANNOUNCE: 97/07/15 Release of RADBIB97.BIB
------------------------------------------
RADBIB97 is a comprehensive bibliography of radiosity and
related global illumination papers, theses, articles, and
books. It currently includes 1,164 references.

This bibliography is available in BibTex format as
RADBIB97.BIB (with a release date of July 15, 1997) from:

  http://www.ledalite.com/library-/rrt.htm
  ftp://ftp.ledalite.com/pub/radbib97.bib

As always, it is time-consuming and sometimes difficult to
track down conference papers and theses on radiosity and global
illumination. If you know of a relevant reference that is not
included in the bibliography, please let me know so that I can
include it in the next release.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Just a reminder that the radiosity software and experimental system used in
our comparison of radiosity methods is available from
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~radiosity/dist. (The comparison was presented at the
recent Eurographics Workshop on Rendering.) The software supports matrix,
progressive, and wavelet radiosity (bases: M2/M3/F2/F3), T-vertex
elimination, and more. The code is set up to compile under Irix, but it
should be easily portable to anything with a C++ compiler and an OpenGL
library.

Cheers,

Andrew

Hello all,

I am trying to track down the .ps or .tex file on notations and terminology
used for global illumination research that is linked from the Eurographics
working group on rendering home page.

The ftp link to tiber.nist.gov/pub/holly/symb.tex is dead. Does anybody
know if the documents are available from anywhere else?

Thanks

Simon

Hi --
The files on  tiber.nist.gov/pub/holly left NIST when I did.
I still have the files, but I can't make them available via ftp because
of the fire wall here.  I'm emailing symb.tex to Simon. If anyone has
a site where they can keep the documents I will be happy to email
them to you, and the Eurographics links can be updated.

Subject: Siggraph Globillum Meeting
Cc: drb@sgi.com
Status: R

Well, since no one volunteered to take notes at the Globillum meeting on
Thursday at Siggraph, you're stuck with my ratty minutes again this year.

There was some confusion on the time for the meeting -- some thought it
was to start at 12:30, and some thought 1:00.  Since the judges of the
all-important Siggraph T-shirt contest had the room until 1:00, the few
of us who showed up at 12:30 went around and (re)introduced ourselves
outside while we waited for the room and for the others to arrive.  By
the time 1pm rolled around, there were quite a few of us who had been
introduced, and folks were still trickling into the room, so I apologize
that not everyone got a proper chance to hear the early birds' names.

We had quite a turnout this year, and I attempted to get everyone's names
down, but I'm sure I missed a few (and misspelled a few more).  Nevertheless,
I've included this list of names at the bottom, in case you find a friend
there who can tell you about the meeting first-hand.

After the aforementioned haphazard introductions, Fern Hunt of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology gave a scheduled
presentation of the work she is doing on BRDF measurement and
characterization with Mary McKnight and others at NIST, in cooperation
with industry.  Dr. Hunt is one of a few mathematicians at NIST who are
attempting to predict BRDFs (bidirectional reflection distribution
functions) from paint compositions and application techniques.
Specifically, they are asking the question, "If you have some material,
and you know its physical characteristics and topography, what else do
you need to know to recreate its appearance; what accuracy levels are
needed?"  NIST of course has some of the most (if not THE most)
sophisticated equipment for measuring surface reflectance and
topography, and they are very interested in working with industry and
research institutions to make this information more useful and available.

Bob Lipman (also of NIST) then talked about a newly available database of
BRDFs for various common materials, collected by the CIA for use in analyzing
satellite images.  Recently declassified (and simultaneously defunded), the
NEF database (obviously stands for "Nonconventional Exploitation Factors")
contains hundreds(?) of exterior finishes and natural materials,
characterized by full spectral reflectance models and measurements.  It
was meticulously created by the National Imaging and Mapping Agency,
and represents a huge effort.  I strongly recommend to anyone
interested in material reflectance data that they go check it out.
For more information, see the following web sites:

	http://math.nist.gov/mcsd/Staff/RLipman/appearance/
	http://math.nist.gov/mcsd/Staff/RLipman/brdf/nefhome.html

The interface to the database currently runs only under Solaris, and Bob
is looking to create a simpler interface to access the data under other
systems, as well as seeing if the current interface can be ported.  (His
initial attempts to do so failed for unknown reasons.)

Fern Hunt can be reached at <fern.hunt@nist.gov>, (301) 975-3887.
Bob Lipman is at <robert.lipman@nist.gov>, (301) 975-3829.

Fern also reminded the group that they are still looking for someone
for a post-doc position in realistic image synthesis funded by the National
Research Council, for which they are taking applications until Jan. 15,
1998.  They promised to have an announcement soon at the following URL:

	http://rap.nas.edu/lab/NIST/

(Bear in mind that there is a U.S. citizenship requirement for this position.)

Next, I brought up a subject that has been popular at past globillum meetings,
which is lighting and level of realism in the entertainment (i.e., film
animation) industry.  Specifically, I was wondering why global illumination
is not more widely used for producing digital effects, which to my eye still
look pretty fake due to poor lighting and color.  Larry Gritz (of Pixar) had
quite a bit to say on this topic, since he has spent some time on both sides
of the fence.  As the author of the Blue Moon Rendering Tools, Larry knows
that global illumination techniques can be quite effective at improving the
realism of rendered environments, even within the Renderman specification.
However, he has seen expert "lighters," as they're called, do a much better
job producing convincing effects for movies like "Toy Story" without any
kind of global calculations going on.  In fact, Larry said that global
effects can often be exactly what you DON'T want when lighting a scene,
since the addition of a light in one corner can screw up the lighting you
just tweaked to perfection in the other corner.

Alain Fournier of the University of British Columbia and Mayur Patel of
Disney Engineering also participated in the conversation (among others), and
in the end there seemed to be some agreement that there is a lot of room
for improvement in existing animation systems.  Specifically, there must
be some way to ease the burden lighting places on scene design with better
global illumination that still does not diminish creative control.  Anything
they can do to keep the computer graphics from jumping off the screen and
saying "Hey, I was done with computer graphics!" would be great by me.

Finally, Paul Heckbert (of Carnegie Mellon University) brought up the issue
of code sharing, and suggested that we post announcements to the group if
we have some code or results we want to share via the internet.  No one
seemed to object to this, given how light traffic on globillum usually is.
Anyway, to get the ball rolling, here are a few links that people volunteered:

		http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html

Also, I plan to announce a high dynamic-range format within TIFF for images
using a logL (u',v') color system in 32-bits/pixel, which is even better
than the one used in Radiance since it is not gamut-limited.  This will be
released as part of Sam Leffler's TIFF library.  I hope to have it ready
(with an X11 viewer) by the end of this month.

Hi Alex.  I was at your demo directly after the papers session at SIGGRAPH.
My first question: Is the reason that an O2 is required the stencil planes 
or the accumulation buffer speed?

With regards to the accumulation buffer, I just wrote a special-case 
version at work that runs on PCs.  The accumulation buffer in OpenGL 
handles arbitrary combinations of images, and each time glAccum is called 
it converts the pixels to floating-point format and then does a multiply 
per pixel to add them -- not too efficient!  (Some implementations may 
optimize this in integer, but the multiply remains.)

If you instead assume that you just want to "average" a number of images 
equally -- the most common case for the accumulation buffer -- you can 
implement the same thing in software (using glReadPixels to read into a 
local buffer) with very good performance.  My implementation is doing 
better than 30 accumulation buffer operations per second (a special case of 
glAccum) at 640x480 in 24-bit RGB, which is more than enough for decent 
results with your algorithm.  The basic idea is to restrict yourself to one 
or two adds per pixel, and then make the return step do an optimized scale 
to average the output.  (This requires a 16-16-16 bit intermediate image.

All this work doesn't buy you anything on a RealityEngine, but it might be 
cool to see a port to lower-end machines.  I think that performance 
wouldn't hinder you, since $400 cards on the PC can double the O2's polygon 
performance in many cases.

thanks,
mike

My (correct) name is Wolfgang Stuerzlinger and I am currently a visiting
post-graduate researcher at UNC Chapel Hill (originally from Univ. Linz,
Austria, so Greg's entry is almost correct :-).

My WWW-page is at: http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stuerzl. 
Parts of my globillum code (e.g. hemispherical projection, discontinuity
meshing) and almost all my publications are available there. 

Wolfgang

P.S.: My current entry on reseach interests in globillum reads:
In the area of globillum I am doing research on hardware accelerated
methods for displaying results of diffuse+glossy+mirror globillum
simulations. Also I am interested in hardware accelerated methods for
solving the rendering equation.

Hi guys,

I have finish my MSc thesis and have setup a permanant website for that over
at University of Leeds - http://dream.leeds.ac.uk/cuddles/rover

The site contains the thesis itself, images, hyperlink abstracts and biblio.,
huge collection of links on radiosity papers on the Web, free radiosity 
software on the web, and many others. 

Thanks for everything and I hope you'll find the resources compiled there
useful for your work.

Thank you very much for this excellent website. Unfortunately I have
some 
problems when I try to access the paper collection, the videos and
VRMLs  
(e.g. The requested URL /cuddles/rover/sport/rad.1/book.at/modildsf.ps
was not found on this server). Is there something going wrong ?

Best regards,

You might have notice the icon "CD Only". As the total space would be
450mb, and we are only given 25mb on the website, I have chose to put the
Video, VRML, papers on the CDROM. Considering the I got all the resources
from the website, you might want to do some seek and conquer thingy. But
if you still cannot find it, I'll attach as a file to you? Alternatively I
could upload it to a FTP site for your download?

FUNCTIONS OF CATEGORY EDITORS

These guidelines were drafted by Jean E. Sammet in 1985 and updated in
1994.

The basic functions of each Category Editor (CE) are to improve the
quality and to increase the quantity of reviews for Computing Reviews
(CR). ACM Headquarters is responsible for producing CR. The separate
responsibilities of HQ and the category editors follow.

ACM Headquarters Basic Responsibilities

1. acquiring material (with input from CEs for unusual material)
2. maintaining reviewer database (additions, deletions, and changes)
3. assigning priorities for reviewing
4. assigning material to specific reviewers
5. receiving, processing, and editing the reviews and scheduling them for
 publication

Category Editor's Responsibilities

1. Provide advice and aid to HQ and Editor-in-Chief (EIC) for special
projects (as requested by HQ or EIC)

2. Specify items that deserve quickly published reviews. Guidelines for
priority identification:

  a. Do this even for journals that already receive high coverage.
  b. Do not do this for ACM journals, because HQ sometimes works from page
 proofs of these.
  c. For journals or proceedings that HQ does not normally receive, the CE
 must send a copy of the paper to HQ, or the coverage will be delayed
 while HQ obtains the document.
  d. Specify articles in ACM SIG newsletters that should be reviewed.

3. Examine reviews after they are sent to Headquarters (normally sent to
CEs within 5 working days after it arrives at HQ). Guidelines for review
examination:

  a. Notify ACM HQ within one week of receipt of changes needed for
categories and/or General Terms, and your evaluation of each review.
Rate the review on a scale from 1--5 for technical content (TE),
completeness (CO), and clarity (CL). Electronic mail should be used if
possible. Mail to reviews@cr.acm.org. If using regular mail, send to:
ACM Computing Reviews, 1515 Broadway, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10036.

  b. Notify ACM HQ within one week of reviews that are not acceptable to
publish or require substantial revision.  Particular attention should be
paid to the length of reviews. Reviews of books should be between 250
and 800 words, depending on the length and/or importance of the book.
Reviews of papers or book chapters should be between 100 and 250 words.
There is no length limit for Comparative, Feature, and Scholarly
reviews. The Managing Editor, Associate Editor, and Assignment Editor
work closely with reviewers to keep these special reviews to an
appropriate length.

  c. Make suggestions to help reviewer improve future reviews. Do this in any
time period you feel is appropriate and use any format you are
comfortable with.

4. Collaborate with ACM HQ (Assignment Editor) to suggest Comparative book
reviews. In special cases, the CE and assignment editor may also get
involved in single book review problems. Suggest reviewers for
Comparative reviews.

5. Notify HQ of "obscure" documents not normally reviewed---but needing
review---and suggest reviewers, if possible. This includes proceedings,
journals not normally received at HQ, university press publications,
videotapes, and books from obscure publishers. Provide HQ with full
source information, author, and title.

6. Notify HQ of new journals along with recommendation of level of coverage
(full, moderate, or occasional).

7. Suggest specific reviewers to HQ for specific documents whenever
appropriate. Timing is critical and notification by CE to HQ must be
rapid, or this won't work.

8. Recruit reviewers for your area. If possible, use specific approaches
unique to your area. Rate reviewers.

9. Recruit outstanding and well-known experts to review special items,
under the condition that this does not interfere with normal HQ
operations. This will only be effective if based on personal contact and
special arrangements.

10. Write reviews yourself at least twice a year.

11. Review your portion of the category tree and make recommendations for
changes as requested by the EIC.

12. Prepare index terms for items not in the category tree as requested by
the EIC.

13. Recommend important conference papers for review.
Solicit Scholarly and Feature reviews.

General note: Because no single CE is likely to be equally familiar with
all the topics under the category, it is permissible (and encouraged)
for each Category Editor to find one or more assistants to carry out
many of the above tasks for a subcategory, or to provide advice. This
should be done on an informal basis. The CE retains authority and
responsibility.

Hi.

I'm curious, because it would seem that almost everyone dealing with
formfactors would sooner or later face this very same problem, so maybe there
exists some nice mathematical (or *any*, for that matter :) ) solution for it:

For my radiosity algorithm I'm using the exact Point-to-Area-FormFactor,
calculating the contour integral around the emitter in respect to a certain
point on the receiver and its normal at that point.

The well known formula (which I know under the name 'Prisma Formel') is:
                       _  _
FdAeAs = -1/(2*PI)*SUM(Gi*N)
      _                                           _
where N is the normal at the receiver vertex, and Gi is the cross product of
the vectors from the receiver vertex to the two endpoints of an emitter edge.
The SUM is a sum of the dot product for these two vectors, for all the emitter
edges.

I currently know of two ways to compute this sum. One I'm using myself,
involving the acos of the angle between the two vectors that form Gi, and the
cross product Gi itself. The other I found in "An Empirical Comparison of
Radiosity Algorithms" (Willmot/Heckbert), which involves atan and some other
values.

Both of them have a general problem if the receiver point lies somewhere in the
emitter plane (I think the latter fixes this for some cases - I didn't check it
thoroughly, but I assume it fixes it in the rectangular case), or more exactly
on one or more of the lines the emitter edges form.

These are the cases that can happen (The formulas mentioned here I found by
empirical analysis of the corresponding scenes...):
- if the receiver vertex (say 'A') is outside the emitter, but still inside its
plane, the FF is obviously 0.
- if A is inside the emitter, then the FF is 1 if receiver and emitter are
parallel, otherwise it must be handled as if A were on an edge of the emitter.
- if A is on an edge of the emitter, the FF is 0.5*(1+cos(alpha)), with alpha
being the angle between emitter and receiver. Special case: alpha==0 -> FF=0.5
- if A is at a vertex of the emitter, I've got a problem...

By naive empirical analysis, I managed to find a solution for the following
cases (A at an emitter vertex):

  /|E
 / |____
|  /   /R
| /   /
|/___/     (side view)

- if emitter and receiver are rectangular, the FF at the vertex is
0.25*(1+cos(alpha)). (alpha= angle between emitter and receiver)

   _______
   \      |E
    \  b2 |
     \    |
      \   |
       \  |
   b1   \ |
   ______\|
  /        \
 /          \
/____________\R   (front view)

- if alpha is a right angle, and the angle of the emitter is beta2 (b2), and
the angle between the receiver edge in the emitter plane and the emitter is
beta1 (b1), and beta=b1+b2 (are you still with me? :) ), then the FF is
0.25*(cos(beta1)-cos(beta)).

...well, that's as far as I got. It seems already that the combination of these
two cases (varying alpha *and* beta1/beta) isn't that simple that it can be
figured out just by writing down some values and trying.

My hope is that there is a (or several) formula for the general case (e.g. the
result seems also to depend on how I approach the receiver vertex - and thus on
the angle of the receiver).

One simple way to 'solve' it, is just to move the receiver vertex away from the
emitter plane, but this looks more like a workaround and it might even lead to
other problems. - is this how everybody does it ;-) or are there other ways to
get a correct FF value for these cases?

Any suggestions/help appreciated.
Thanks!

Cheers,

Wolfram

ANNOUNCE: 97/09/01 Release of RADBIB97.BIB and GITHESIS.BIB
-----------------------------------------------------------
RADBIB97 is a comprehensive bibliography of radiosity and
related global illumination papers, theses, articles, and
books. It currently includes 1,219 references -- 55 new
additions since the 97/07/15 release!

This bibliography is available in BibTex format as
RADBIB97.BIB (with a release date of September 1, 1997)
from:

  http://www.ledalite.com/library-/rrt.htm
  ftp://ftp.ledalite.com/pub/radbib97.bib

Also available from this site is an abridged version of
RADBIB97.BIB called GITHESIS.BIB. This bibliography
includes 138 references to radiosity and global
illumination theses.

As always, it is time-consuming and sometimes difficult to
track down conference papers and theses on radiosity and
global illumination. If you know of a relevant reference
that is not included in these bibliographies, please let us
know so that we can include it in the next release.

Partial financial support for the maintenance of these
bibliographies has been provided by the ACM SIGGRAPH
Special Projects.

Hi All,

As promised, I have put together some web pages describing a new
addition to Sam Leffler's TIFF library, with facilities for reading
and writing high dynamic-range images.  See:

	http://www.sgi.com/Technology/pixformat/

The format is based on a 16-bit log encoding of luminance, plus a
16-bit encoding of color in CIE (u',v') coordinates.  This allows
the format to cover the full range of human vision in imperceptible
steps.  In fact, the encoding covers over 38 orders of magnitude,
which means that you don't have to worry about exposure when
storing your global illumination calculations.

I have included over 100 example images, mostly Radiance renderings
but some scanned images from Debevec and Malik's '97 Siggraph paper
and my own experiments.  I'm hoping this will encourage people to
download and compile the library and viewer and start playing around
with tone-mapping algorithms and the like.  For those of you who
want to experiment with image-based rendering algorithms, I have
also included 5 cylindrical (360 degree) panoramas.

Let me know if you have any problems, questions or suggestions.

-Greg

Do you know if others are having problems.

Hi Michael,

I don't know what the problem is -- Holly accessed it from IBM and it worked
OK, and I can get to it from my UCB machine.  All I can suggest is that
you try it again later, or else complain to whoever is cutting off the
SGI website.  (I know you meant this as a joke, but....)

So, the story I get is that SGI blocks hits from MS because some idiots

something.

Anyway, I'll find a way around it.

  One of my students at GWU, Sang Yoon Lee, has implemented Nelson Max's

adaptive level of detail.

  The resulting images are worth a look (I've wanted to see such results 
for years!):

Subject: webmover program
Status: R

Hi Everyone,

I just wrote a program that has nothing to do with global illumination,
but I don't belong to any appropriate groups so I thought I'd announce
it here, anyway.  It's a little utility for checking and moving web
pages.  It's especially useful for translating web pages you want to
publish on a CD-ROM in ISO-9660 format.  I am faced with this task
myself, translating the Radiance web pages for a CD-ROM to accompany
the book Rob Shakespeare and I wrote on Radiance for Morgan Kaufmann.
(Plug: the book should be out early next year.)

If you've ever had to go through a large web site, renaming files and
fixing links, you know what a pain it can be.  This program does it
for you, and it's fast and it's free (with no warranty!).  Here's the
help screen:

Usage: webmover [-u|-i|-d][-v] base_URL orig_dir/[html] [new_dir/[html]]
   Or: webmover -h[elp]

Arguments to webmover and their interpretation:
base_URL        The starting point for this website (beginning with "http://")
orig_dir/[html] The original directory [and front page] relative to base_URL
                If [html] is left off, then we assume "index.html"
newdir/[html]   The destination directory [and front page] relative to base_URL
                This new directory must not exist.
                If this argument is left off, webmover just checks pages.

Options to webmover and their meanings:
        -u      Convert to UNIX file naming conventions and newline
        -i      Convert to ISO-9660 file naming conventions
        -d      Convert to DOS file naming conventions and newline
        -v      Verbose reporting of progress to stdout

Assumptions made by webmover:
o Only move what front page references, directly and indirectly
o Overhead references (above front page directory) are not moved
o No non-printing, non-white characters are desired in pages
o Symbolic links are followed and not treated specially
o Hard links are made to destination whenever possible
o Hard links are preserved among files

The following file suffixes are recognized:
    ____UNIX____ISO____
        html    htm
        jpeg    jpg
        tiff    tif
        tar.Z   trz
        ps.Z    psz
        tar.gz  tgz
        ps.gz   pgz
        text    txt
        jfif    jff

-------------------------------
To pick it up, just follow the URL below:

Feel free to share this with whomever you like.  It's public domain.

I apologize for this potential misuse of the list-- I would like
to spread the word that we are trying to increase our grad population size
at Utah, and if possible please pass on the following tidbits to your seniors
considering grad school (in graphics or not):

1) Almost all students get assitantships
2) Cohen/Johnson/Shirley/Riesenfeld/Hansen/Smits here as 
   either profs or postdocs-- that is two modeling, two
   rendering, and two viz people.
3) Much equipemnt including Origin2000 with RealityMonster
4) Free online application-- see www.cs.utah.edu

As for lifestyle, this is the best place I know of for
outdoorsy types that still want to be able to see an art-film
or get an expresso or microbrew.  It is probably not
a good place for true urbanites or people that want a small town.

Thanks,

Pete Shirley

PS-- obligatory globillum material-- I just returned from Pacific Graphics 97
and Parallel Rendering 97.  I saw three different talks that had radiosity
solutions on models with more than 0.5 million initial patches.  
Also, it was mentioned that the next version of doom has full radiosity
solutions!

     I'd like to mention a resource here that is worth knowing about: ACM 
     Transactions on Graphics and all other ACM journals are now searchable 
     online via ACM's Digital Library. Also, many articles are becoming 
     available in digital form to subscribers. Until the end of the year 
     the search engine is available to anyone for free. The Digital Library 
     is located at:
     
        http://www.acm.org/dl/
     
     As an example, here are the publications found when searching on 
     radiosity or global illumination as keywords (excuse the margins):
     
                         1)

  Hello globillumers,
I just had a message from a student, asking
for some test scenes to check his radiosity
program. I immediately thought of this nice
set of 10 test scenes that was released for
the fifth Eurographics Workshop on Rendering
(by Peter Shirley, if my memory serves me
well). However, I couldn't remember where
to find them. 

Can anyone help me?

Peter Shirley's test scenes are together with a bunch of scenes taken
from Radiance at the MGF web site:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/

There is also a free parser library for reading the data, documentation, etc.

Here's one of my favourites:

Everyone knows that if all surfaces in a scene have relfectance and
emittance equal to 0.5, the total radiance will be 1 everywhere. It's
one of the few cases where you have an analytical solution, regardless
of the scene geometry. Actually, this is true as long as the sum of
the reflectance and emittance is everywhere equal to one. This doesn't mean
that the reflectances have to be equal everywhere: Take e.g. a labyrinth
scene with a few patches that are almost perfect emittors (emittance 0.99
and reflectance 0.01) while all others are almost perfect reflectors
(emittance 0.01 and reflectance 0.99). Also in this case, the total
radiance will be equal to one everywhere, but it's a very nice experiment 
to test out what your radiosity implementation does with it.

It was suggested to me by Laszlo and Attila Neumann.

Regards,

Philippe.

Some people doubt whether it is true that the total radiance in
a diffuse scene will be everywhere equal to one if the sum of emittance
and reflectance is everyhwere equal to one. Well ... they are right: 
it's not always true. I forgot to mention that the scenes should be
closed.

But the proof (for closed scenes) is as follows:

Consider first the "radiosity case":

	L_i = E_i + rho_i sum_j F_ij L_j

My claim is that if E_i + rho_i = 1 for all patches i, then also L_i = 1
for all patches. 

Proof: fill L_i = 1 for all patches in the radiance equation:

	1 = E_i + rho_i sum_j F_ij 1

sum_j F_ij = 1 in a closed environment, so this would imply:

	1 = E_i + rho_i

and that's exactly what I supposed. It *is* a proof because the solution
of the radiance equation is unique.

The proof without discretising is very similar. And the result
can be generalized to non diffuse environments: the radiance leaving
any point in any direction will be equal to one if the sum of selfemitted
radiance L_e(x, theta_out) + albedo rho(x, theta_out) equals 1 for all
points x and directions theta_out, with

	rho(x, theta_out) = integral over hemisphere at x of 
		brdf f_r(x, theta_in, theta_out) times 
		cos(angle between theta_in and normal at x) times 
		differential solid angle around theta_in

Sorry for wasting your time if you already knew this.

Best regards,

Philippe.

Sorry to have to bring up something that has little to do with
computer graphics, but the serious problem of spam has finally reached
the globillum listserver. You no doubt would have received (perhaps
twice) unsolicited commercial email (UCE) with the following headers:

I have taken great pains to fit a personalised and highly tuned spam
filter on my college email box in order to make this channel of
communication usable again. Naturally I have implemented an
unconditional bypass for all the mailing lists that I have subscribed
to. I consider the information posted to this forum very valuable and
would hate to have to apply anti-spam filtering to messages posted
here, lest I lose an article of considerable importance.

In this context, I ask what actions will the list maintainers be
taking to prevent more UCE from flooding this list, making unfair
usage of resources (list server, disk quota), and if left unchecked
rendering this mailing list unusable? Will someone be reporting this
to news:news.admin.net-abuse.email and
news:news.admin.net-abuse.sightings ?

Any comments welcome. (Perhaps better if discussed off this
forum. Make sure it doesn't resemble spam.)

PS. Okay, I finally thought of an on-topic question. What modelling
software do you professionals use to construct your test scenes? Is it
commercial? Is there something I can download off the Net for any UNIX
box running X, (with source) ? And handles parametric curved surfaces? I
find that text editing a scripted modelling language falls far short
of a real GUI-interface modeller.

For those of you who teach global illumination, there is a just-
published survey paper that may be of interest:

  Nievergelt, Yves. 1997. "Radiosity in Illumination Engineering,"
  UMAP Journal 18(2):167-178 (Summer).

The paper provides an overview of the radiosity equation and its
application to the engineering design of lighting systems, with
topic headings such as "Lambertian Surfaces," "Luminous Flux,"
"Form Factors for Lambertian Surfaces," "Setting Up Radiosity
Systems," "Solving Large Radiosity Systems," "How Southwell's
Method is Used," and "Inverse Problems." As you may have surmised,
it is entirely concerned with applied mathematics.

I like this paper because it offers a fresh perspective from a
mathematician's point of view. More important, it poses four
open questions in the mathematics of global illumination that
should interest motivated graduate students. (Even better, what
is the relationship between radiosity systems and Ansel Adam's
1941 photograph "Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico?")

UMAP is the Journal of Undergraduate Mathematics and its
Applications. If radiosity in illumination engineering doesn't
garner your attention, you might consider some of the other
articles, including "Communication Games and the Canadian
Constitution," "The Mathematics of Scuba Diving," and "How
Does the NFL Rate Passers?" It's an interesting publication.

Hi all,

Sorry to bother you, but I wanted to re-assure you all that whenever
a SPAM-like message is sent to globillum, I protest in all the ways
I am aware of.
In the latest case, I had the sender domain added to our local black list,
and also manually removed the globillum address from the marketer's
web site. 

I will not send such a message every time a problem happens, but be sure
I do everything I can to avoid such problems.

What is the best way to quantize floating point RGB colors (0 to 1)
into 8-bit integers?  Is the answer different for different output
devices?

Well, the quantization should probably be non-linear, as the eye is
more sensitive to quantization in dark areas of the image. I prefer
using a gamma correction of 2.2, which then can be re-corrected for a
particular output device.

I would also add random dither before quantization to reduce visible
quantization artifacts further.

How about

  pixel_val = (int) ( 255.0 * pow ( float_val, 0.45 ) * drand48() );

for a start? This will

o correct for a gamma of 2.2222...

o scale to the range 0:255

o add 0.5 for correct rounding

o add random noise in the range -0.5:0.5

There's a bit of inconsistency here, as we're assuming nonlinearity in
the output device, but adding noise that's uniformly distributed. But
I think it will work pretty well.

Hi gang.

I have updated the conference announcements on my web-page:

http://www.cs.utah.edu/~shirley/

This includes the rendering workshop page (which I had a little
trouble finding-- please add links to this on your own pages!).

I know I am missing several workshops-- updates appreciated.

Thanks,

Pete

     I just ran across an interesting resource. See the graph at:
     
     http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/Graphics/rad.html
     
     near the bottom. It shows the raw number of references in the 
     radiosity bibliography peaked in 1994 (for comparison, ray tracing 
     peaks in 1990). It's also interesting to look at SIGGRAPH's 
     comprehensive bibliography graphed in this way: 1983 has the most 
     articles published, with other peaks (though decreasing) in 1991 and 
     1995 (4 year cycle? ;-> ).

Ah, but it's the *quality* of the papers that really matters. There
are still many open questions in radiative transfer/radiosity theory,
and from what I have seen of the publications over the past few years,
1994 was the beginning of a trend towards investigating the deeper
problems.

For whatever reason, most the really interesting work is now being
done in Europe, Asia and the Far East. Cornell's legacy unfortunately
appears to be on the wane in North America.

P.S. - the latest RADBIB97.BIB and GITHESIS.BIB bibliographies are
       being released later today. I managed to find only nine new
       references for global illumination in the past two months
       instead of the usual fifteen to thirty. Hmm ...

Hi,

I would be grateful if anyone on the list could provide me with any
useful suggestions on the following:

I'm currently working on code designed to shoot photons at random into a
scene from a variety of light sources. This will involve a considerable
amount of random sampling. For example, given a  set of lights we need
to determine at random which light to shoot a photon from. Then if the
light source is made up of multiple polygons, which polygon do we shoot
from and whereabouts on the polygon. Finally what will the initial
direction of the photon be?

The solution we intend to implement involves a certain amount of
preprocessing for each test so that we end up with a probability
distribution that can be quickly sampled to return a random selection (a
light say) during shooting of photons. The goal is a generic process
which, when given a set of N outcomes and N weights generates a data
structure. This data structure will then need to be interrogated by a
function which takes a random float in the range [0,1) and as quickly as
possible returns one of the outcomes. The probability of returning any
given outcome is proportional to the weight assigned to that outcome
(for example for lights we would assign weights according to the output
power of each light). 

Currently I am thinking about implementing the data structure produced
by pre-processing as either a lookup table or a binary tree. The lookup
table approach is very fast, but more memory intensive, whilst the
binary tree approach would use less memory, but be slower.  

To clarify the problem, here is a very simple example. Take a scene with
5 light sources with respective powers of 50W 10W 5W 20W and 15W. In our
current binary tree approach we would divide the region [0,1) as
follows:

Values in the range [0, 0.5) represent choosing the first light, values
in the range [0.5, 0.6) the second, 
values in the range [0.6, 0.65) the third,
values in the range [0.65, 0.85) the fourth and
values in the range [0.85, 1) the fifth  

To then actually convert from a random number in the range [0,1) to a
light, the lights could be arranged in a binary tree something like the
following:


        [P<0.65]     0 [P>=0.65]
                    / \
        [P<0.6]    O   O [P>=0.85]
                  / \ / \
                 O  3 4  5
                / \ 
               1   2

At the first level of the tree, testing of whether the random value P is
< or >= 0.65 (chosen so that roughly the same numbers of lights fall on
each side) takes us down either the left or right branch. Further tests
then occur at each level, for example P is < or >= 0.6 for the left-hand
branch, until we arrive at a light.

In a lookup table approach we have to subdivide the range [0,1) into a
set of bins, the size of which is determined by the relative size of the
smallest weight in the list of possible outcomes. Given the number of
bins we can immediately convert a random float in the range [0,1) into
an array index which points at one of the outcomes. As I said before
this approach is very fast, but uses more memory, especially in cases
where there is a large relative difference in weights between the most
likely and least likely outcomes (we are forced to use a lot of small
bins in order to include every possible outcome).

I am keen to hear from anyone who has experience in this area or anyone
who can suggest improvements to the solutions I have outlined above, or
indeed any better solutions.

Many thanks,

Tim.

If you want complete accuracy in the lookup table, you need to make all the
weights be rational numbers, and make the size of the table the common
denominator (the least common multiple of all the denominators when each
fraction is in "reduced" form, with no common factors in the numerator and
denominator). I think this is worse than you indicated.

How about a compromise between the two methods: let a smaller table point to a
(possibly internal) node of the tree, at which to begin the search.

I would go with the table approach. This is grossly simplified, but the 
table grows linearly with the number of lights if the light source power 
values are all approximately the same order of magnitude (This statement 
is clearly subject to verification). Can you characterize the typical 
scene? If you were going to have lots of scenes with 1000 suns and 1 
flashlight, the table might not be a reasonable approach.

If you had 100 light sources at 100W and one light source at 1W, you 
would be using approximately 40Kb (assuming the table stored a 4 byte 
pointer). In a commercial, high end rendering product, I would consider 
even 100 times this requirement to be modest if the gain is significant, 
especially if the model is already so complex as to include 101 distinct 
light sources.

Would it be reasonable to simply reject sources which are extremely 
unlikely to contribute? In the example above, eliminating the 1W light 
source (with an occurrence probability of 1e-4) reduces a 40Kb table to 
400 bytes. Doing this clearly helps to reduce the table size, but it is 
easy to imagine a scene with a sun and a flashlight where the point of 
interest is illuminated only by the flashlight. Perhaps a very coarse
pre-process which propogates importance from the viewpoint(s) would be
useful.

    >         [P<0.6]    O   O [P>=0.85]
    >                   / \ / \
    >                  O  3 4  5
    >                 / \

    > 
    > At the first level of the tree, testing of whether the random value P is
    > < or >= 0.65 (chosen so that roughly the same numbers of lights fall on

    > In a lookup table approach we have to subdivide the range [0,1) into a

You can also precompute a vector s[i] = sum{ p[j] : j < i }, where
p[j] is the desired probability of chosing item j.  Then you generate
a random P in [0 _ 1], and use binary search on s to locate an i such
that s[i] < P < s[i+i].  This is simpler than building a binary tree,
and at least as fast if coded with care.

Moreover, if you expect a large number of items with similar probabilities,
you can use linear interpolation (i.e. round(P*n) \pm K) to guess
an initial range for the binary search.

IBR.BIB.

There are currently 55 references in the bibliography -- more will be added
as we
continue to research the literature.

IBR.BIB will be hosted by http://www.ledalite.com, and future releases will
be
announced (not e-mailed) as they become available.

Funding for the ongoing maintenance of this bibliography is provided by
byHeart Consultants Limited (West Vancouver, BC) and an ACM SIGGRAPH

Hello everyone,

For those who are interested, my thesis is now available online:

	Robust Monte Carlo Methods for Light Transport Simulation

		            Eric Veach
		 	Ph.D. dissertation
		       Stanford University
			  December 1997

	    http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis/


It describes techniques such as Metropolis light transport,
multiple importance sampling, and bidirectional path tracing in
more detail than in the corresponding papers.  It also includes
quite a bit of new material, including studies of:

  - the inherent limitations of unbiased Monte Carlo methods
  - new variance reduction techniques
  - the history of reciprocity principles and important exceptions to them
  - the derivation of a new reciprocity principle that applies to materials
    that transmit as well as reflect light  [i.e. BTDF's as well as BRDF's]

You can find the abstract and table of contents on the web page,
as well as Postscript and PDF versions of the thesis.

Best regards,
Eric

Hi all.  I have a student working on creating sky dome 
radiance functions.  A couple of questions:

1) Are any of you aware of newer models than the
   classic CIE models?  I seem to remember
   Nishita discussing a recent one and I can't find it
   in his papers.

2) Does the CIE luminance function include the sun or not?
   Its description in Wyszecki&Stiles implies it does not,
   but its actual form has a sun-like spike in it that does
    not look like forward scattering.

Thanks,

Pete

Hi Dr. Peter Shirley;

 I use the classic CIE model.

>2) Does the CIE luminance function include the sun or not?

I believe that it does not include the sun.

>   but its actual form has a sun-like spike in it that does
>   not look like forward scattering.

I think that it due to strong forward scattering from aerosols
particles.

Pete;

when you say "the classic CIE models" do you mean CIE 1973?  I think CIE
1994 has one more sky ... an intermediate sky, but maybe that was there
in 73, too ... dunno.

Anyway, quoting from
CIE Technical Report CIE 110-1994
"Spatial Distribution of Daylight - Luminance Distributions of Various
Reference Skies"
ISBN 3 900 734 52 6

They say on pg 1 ...
"The skies treated in this report do not include direct sunlight"

I think the spike you are seeing is to be expected ... the sky dome
being illuminated most markedly where the sun is.

best wishes

Neil

Hi Pete,

If you haven't already, do check out the Perez sky model, which is much
better than any of the CIE models.  Richard Perez teaches at SUNY in
Albany, I believe.  The articles I have of his appeared in "Solar
Energy," one from 1990 and another from 1992.  I just did a web search
and found the following page, which seems to indicate that he's moved
to USC:

	http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~rhperez/

There appears to be NO data at this site, however, and I am wondering if
it's even the same guy.  If you can't find his papers, I can make lousy
copies of mine for you.  There's also an intermediate sky model,
introduced by the CIE more recently.  Though it's not as complete as
Perez's work, it's still better than the clear and overcast approximations.

-Greg

Perez et al. (1993) are introducing a sky model which is a generalization of
the CIE standard clear sky formula and includes 5 parameters that can be
adjusted to account for any luminance distribution ranging from totally
overcast to very clear.
The parameters describe the darkening of the horizon region in respect to the
zenith, the luminance gradient near the horizon, the relative intensity as well
as the width of the circumsolar region, and the relative intensity of the
backscattered light received at the earth's surface.
The CIE clear sky can also be expressed by appropriate settings of these
parameters.
These parameters can be simplified to 'sky clearness' and 'sky brightness',
which can also be derived from actually measured sky data with horizontal
diffuse and normal incident direct irradiance.

No, the direct sunlight has to be accounted for explicitely since it is
described by a narrow angle several levels of magnitude brighter than the
diffuse skylight of the hemisphere. The higher intensity near the circumsolar
region represented in the models is probably caused by some kind of scattering
effect.
The same is true for the Perez model.

     Due to an email request, I've put some old (7 years old or older) 
     rendering comparison images on the web. They're at my homepage:
     
     http://www.acm.org/tog/editors/erich/index.html
     
     About 2/3rds of the way down you'll see thumbnails of sets of images 
     showing some rendering techniques compared. Techniques include 
     z-buffering, traditional ray tracing, stochastic ray tracing, meshed 
     radiosity, and a ray tracing/radiosity blend (tres funky).
     
     Feel free to use them for educational purposes as you wish.

Hello globillumers,

As you know the 'globillum list' has been a target of several spam messages
in the past. Our institution decided to apply a general policy with
mailing lists, in order to avoid such inconvenience. Namely, postings
to the list will be restricted to registered list members.

I think this is compatible with our list, since most messages
are coming from members anyway. But I needed to inform you because
it means that you can only post from the e-mail address that is
know to the list. It may be a slight problem for those with
multiple e-mail addresses.

More importantly, some sites are using a single email alias in the list,
to serve all users locally that are interested in global illumination. These
aliases must be replaced by the complete list of email addresses of
individual people. Please contact me if you are in this situation, otherwise
your local members will not be able to post.

at least the following groups should correct the problem:

> gi-students@graphics.cornell.edu (Cornell Students) 
> globillum@duticg.twi.tudelft.nl (Delft University of Technology graphics group) 
> globillum@loria.fr (LORIA Laboratory) 
> gimagis@safran.imag.fr (Global Illumination group at iMAGIS/IMAG) 
> az@robots.oxford.ac.uk (Andrew Zisserman) 
> glbi@cophos.co.at (Zumtobel Licht GmbH)

Hi Francois,

You'll probably get a ton of messages like this, so I just want to be the
first.  My "official" e-mail address is not one I can send e-mail from.
It is a receiving-only address, "gregl@sgi.com".  It is eventually
forwarded to "gwlarson@positron.CS.Berkeley.EDU", the address from
which I normally send e-mail.  Can you tell me how to correct this
in the globillum database?  Perhaps you can tell everyone.

Thanks, and it was really good to see you at the jury meeting!
-Greg

Welcome to the globillum mailing list!

If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list,
you can send mail to "Majordomo@imag.fr" with the following command
in the body of your email message:

    unsubscribe globillum gwlarson@positron.CS.Berkeley.EDU

Here's the general information for the list you've
subscribed to, in case you don't already have it:

[Last updated on: Wed Jan 22  9:36:39 1997]

The `globillum' mailing list is an electronic discussion forum 
focusing on all issues raised by the computer simulation of
`global illumination' effects.  The mailing list was created by 
Greg Ward in 1989, and subsequently managed by Paul Heckbert. It is 
currently managed by Francois Sillion.

`Global Illumination' is the term used to describe the inter-reflection
effets taking place between a collection of radiating objects. It is
often contrasted to 'local illumination', that is the computation of
the reflected radiance on a surface due to a single light source.

The mailing list is intended mainly for the discussion of research
issues in global illumination. Most members are either students or
work in academic institutions, but there are no access restrictions.
Be warned however that many threads deal with academic issues such
as focused conferences or workshops.

How can I subscribe?

Please do not register directly with Majordomo. Instead, 
Send E-mail to globillum-request@imag.fr, clearly indicating your affiliation
and a one or two-line description of your interests in global
illumination. Note that this is not an automated service, but a
real person at the end of the line! the reason for this is that I would
like to keep some more information about who participates
in the list, as well as keeping it focused.

If you have subscribed to the list, you should have received 
the address of a Web page, giving you access to all
previous discussions on the list.

Hi Francois,

Well, it seems that Slimane has been working here since mid-January.  Sorry
I didn't follow up on him.  He's working under Remi Arnaud, and he says he's
enjoying it very much.  It sounds to me like he's doing some very interesting
work in the performer group.  Anyway, here's his e-mail if you want to write
to him.  (He told me he keeps meaning to drop you a note.)

 shure,

 he is not in locate as SGI maintains only employes in the database.

Hi globillumers,

I'm seeking information about attenuation of light in seawater. Does
anybody have any pointers? I'm not really interested in scattering due to
particles in suspension, only clean, clear water.

TIA,
Bretton

Hi, Bretton. There is some basic information in Chapter 28, "Underwater
Lighting" of the IES Lighting Handbook, Eighth Edition. It includes a
discussion of the absorption coefficient (which is wavelength-dependent) ,
plus scattering information.

The chapter includes 17 references, although these should be sufficient:

Lankes, L. R. 1970. "Optics and the Physical Parameters of the Sea," Opt.
Spectra 4(5):42-49.

Smith, R. C., and K. S. Baker. 1981. "Optical Properties of the Clearest
Natural Waters (200-800 nm)," Applied Optics 20(2):177-184.

Duntley, S. Q. 1963. "Light in the Sea," J. Optical Society of America
53(2):214-233.

Austin, R. W. 1970. "Assessing Underwater Visibility," Opt. Spectra
4(5):34-39.

Kinney, J. A., S. M. Luria and D. O. Weitzman. 1967. "Visibility of Colors

Several people has asked me about the availability of the Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America's "IES Lighting Handbook" that I
referenced in an earlier message.

It appears that Amazon Books (www.amazon.com) is selling the 1987 IES
Lighting Handbook Applications Volume. I have no idea where they are
obtaining copies of this book, as it was superceded by the IES Lighting
Handbook, Eighth Edition in 1993. (Even so, all the good stuff is in the
companion 1987 IES Lighting Handbook Reference Volume. The two volume
were combined to form a 990-page "handbook" for the 1993 edition.)

The IES Lighting Handbook, Eighth Edition, is available directly from
the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America:

Tel: (212) 248-5000
Fax: (212) 248-5017
URL: www.iesna.org

The cost of the book is $389.00 US for non-members and $225.00 US for
members.

Please note that the handbook does *not* include the IESNA Lighting
Library. Of particular interest may be IES LM-63, "Standard File Format
for Electronic Transfer of Photometric Data" ($10.00 members, $18.00
non-members) and ANSI/IES RP-16, "Nomenclature and Definitions for
Illuminating Engineering" ($10.00 members, $15.00 non-members).

The entire IESNA Lighting Library is available for $999.00 For members
and $1,800.00 for non-members. (If you think this is expensive, check
out the cost of the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage
[http://www.cie.co.at/cie/] publications.)

   Hello fellow globillumers,
there is an idea that has been nagging me 
for some time, and I thought I would share
it with the list. 

I couldn't help noticing there is a Workshop
on Rendering for our research results, there
is Siggraph for our outstanding research
results. However, there is nothing to discuss
the specific problems occuring in 
implementations of large rendering systems. 

I'm thinking of large, polyvalent rendering
systems, with several global illumination
algorithms, that deal with 500 K input 
polygons on a daily basis. I'm thinking 
about softwares like Vision, Genesis, 
etc. 

So here is the question: are there people
out there interested in discussing problems
specific to these issues? Expose how you 
deal with 500 K input polygons and 1 Gb
of memory? How long does it take you to 
do the Soda Hall (with furnitures)?

Hi all;

Does anyone know of any companies or academic institutions that can provide
a gonio-photometer service for measuring the BRDFs of everyday materials?

Does anyone have any experiences with such services?  Does anyone know where
any such data is available, to download?

I know about the NIST site, with lots of data that you can't see!  And I
know of a European site that has some fascinating watercress BRDF data (all
I need is the BRDF data for lettuce I can render a really nice salad!)

any help much appreciated

Neil

We will soon here at UBC be able to allow people to design, simulate and 
conduct their own experiments (including measuring BRDF) across the web
on our facility (called ACME, for ACtive MEasurement facility).
It will be at leat a few weeks before we are ready, but stay tuned.

"(all I need is the BRDF data for lettuce I can render a really nice salad!)"
Yes, but what about the vinaigrette (dressing is the most important part of
salad, without it it's just grass).

Should you be happy with just an example, we have full hemispherical BRDF data
for blue latex paint available at our web site:

	http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/measurements/

The data were measured by Sing Foo, and we used them in our Siggraph'97 paper
"Non-Linear Approximation of Reflectance Functions". I've just added some
graphs of the function in the plane of incidence, to give a first impression
of its shape. It's an interesting start for experiments.

With Steve Westin (westin@graphics.cornell.edu) in charge of the measurement
lab, we are doing more measurements, which may become available in the future.
However, it is unlikely that we will ever be a service bureau.

Kind regards,

Eric Lafortune.

Hi global and image-based illuminationerers.

I know some of you who attend the EGWR actually buy the "published" proceedings
after the conference (the nice, very expensive ones).  Unfortunately, a masters
student like me cannot afford those (yet :-).

I know this is probably a shot in the dark, but I'm very interested in buying
your conference version (the cheaper, photocopies-like version you receive at
EGWR itself).

So if you want to get rid of them, I'll give you a few bucks for them, and we
can meet at SIGGRAPH'98 to do the exchange.

If you're interested, you can contact me at blais@iro.umontreal.ca

Best regards to all,



M.

P.S.  Apologies to those people both on the globillum and IBR lists, you'll
receive this post twice.

  Hello fellow globillumers,
We are looking for a PhD student, starting september 1998. The PhD
would be funded by a CIFRE convention. The student would be working
with the ISA research team, following our research on global
illumination algorithms and hierarchical radiosity. 

Since the bursary is a CIFRE, there will be some part of interaction
with industries.

Applications and requests for further information should be directed
to Jean-Claude Paul (Jean-Claude.Paul@inria.fr).

Dear Globillumers,

I feel terrible for taking so long to come back to the issue of
email address filtering on globillum. Some of you might be wondering why their
messages took so long to appear on the list.

As I said, our administrators here decided to prevent posting to mailing lists
from non-members. Since the filter is based on the email address used
to register you in the list, any email sent from another address will
be blocked.

I am appending in the next message the current list of addresses I have. 
Please take a minute to check that your address is correct, and is the one 
used when you *send* messages. 

Some people certainly have a problem, if they use a different email 
address for receiving and sending messages. I don't have a real answer
for them, the only workaround I can see is to add both of their
addresses (they may then receive two copies of each and every
message). When the duplication is due to an anti-spam scheme, one might hope
that one of the two copies will be blocked as "spam" :-)

Anyway, you should ALWAYS be careful when sending email to the list
and check that you are sending from the "authorized" address. I am
also appending a number of messages which were blocked by our system.
Again, please excuse the delay. The authors of all these messages should
definitely contact me to solve the problem.

Please contact me if you have any questions or want your address changed.

And note that membership dues are less than the difference; it's worth
joining just to save money on the handbook.

Hi,

with the help of Tim Rowley, I've gathered a lot of links on the
electronic versions of the papers that will be presented at siggraph
this year.
They are available at 
http://www-imagis.imag.fr/Membres/Fredo.Durand/Book/sig98.html

Not all papers are available at the moment, if you know a link I have
forgotten or missed, please let me know.

By the way, these are part of my collection of computer graphics links
where you can find web pages of researchers, labs, conferences, image
galleries, code, etc.

Dr. Ugur Gudukbay (gudukbay@CS.Bilkent.Edu.TR) and his students at the
Department of Computer Engineering and Information Science, Bilkent
University (Ankara, Turkey) have kindly ported my hopelessly Windows-centric
Helios Radiosity Renderer to the UNIX operating environment.

If anyone is looking for C++ source code for a basic but effective
progressive radiosity renderer, you can download helios_tar.tar from
http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~gudukbay/home.html.

I know that at least Philippe Bekaert and I have adapted wavelet radiosity
to triangular meshes. (I think there are also some triangular coefficients
listed in Peter Schroeder's thesis.)

I have a technical note online at

  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~radiosity/notes/note-coeffs.[ps|pdf]

which discusses wavelet radiosity operations in a matrix-oriented setting,
lists the necessary coefficients for these operations, and gives some
examples of how to use them. It includes coefficients for the M[2-3],
F[2-3] bases for both quadrilaterals and triangles.

You may also want to download Philippe et. al's RenderPark and/or my 'rad'
radiosity program and try looking at the code. They can be found at:

  http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/cwis/research/graphics/RENDERPARK

Cheers,

Andrew

We have a gonioreflectometer that I think of as being on the verge of
operational. While we have no plans to offer a measurement service, we
have posted one measured BRDF, with hopes for more in the future. See

Hi  Globillumers --
I don't remember anyone else bringing this up, but I have been
a little out of touch so maybe I missed it.

Anyway, I just found that Jack Howell's "Catalog of Radiation Heat
Transfer Configuration Factors" is now on line (it used to be only
in a book that you could only find in some Engineering libraries).

It's at:
http://sage.me.utexas.edu/~howell/

Section C is not completely filled in, so perhaps it is still a work in
progress.
At least now everyone can have access to infamous cow factors:

This mailing list has been awfully quiet of late ...

Some of you may know Kendall Jackson as the author of "The Numerical =
Solution of Integral Equations of the Second Kind" (Cambridge University =
Press - http://www.cup.org/Titles/58/0521583918.html) or as editor of =
the Journal of Integral Equations and Applications =
(http://www.math.uiowa.edu/~atkinson/jieapage.html).

Ken has coauthored several very interesting papers on the radiosity =
equation lately. His most recent paper (26 pages!), "The Planar =
Radiosity Equation and its Numerical Solution," is now available as =
rdsty-planar.ps.Z and rdsty-planar.pdf.Z from =
http://www.math.uiowa.edu/ftp/atkinson/.


I have just begun reading this challenging paper, and so I cannot offer =
any comments on it. However, it appears to be an important contribution =
to global illumination research. Given that it will not be published in =
the usual roundup of computer graphics journals, I thought it best to =
bring the paper to the attention of this group.

Ian's note reminded me of two things worth mentioning here.

First, the Nth annual Ray Tracing Roundtable will be meeting at SIGGRAPH on 
Thursday, July 23rd, from 6:15 to 7:45 pm at the Peabody Hotel (across the 
street from the convention center) in Bayhill Rooms I & II. At this event 
we quickly introduce ourselves, then break up to talk with each other about 
what we've been doing in the field. It fits in nicely in the dead time 
between papers and the reception.

Second, I've updated the free ray tracing bibliography at 
http://www.acm.org/tog/resources/bib/, and added a link to search the 
bibliography online (as part of the collection of computer science 
bibliographies, a wonderful free service). Not too many new references, but 
a few - let me know if I've missed your work. I've also made Tom Wilson's 
collection of ray tracing article abstracts available at this site.

 Hi Globillumers.  Two things:
 
 1. Anybody know any good computer graphics references
    which have implemented atmospheric perspective in
    a physically-based way?
 
 2. I am setting up a page of links on global illumination--
    http://www.cs.utah.edu/~shirley/gi/
    it is barely started.  Additions appreciated.

See many of you soon.

I may be using the wrong word-- artists usually call it
aerial perspective-- they way distant objects fade and hue-shift
due to scattering in air.

Hi Pete,

You can do what you want with a pretty simple formula, actually.  I
combine the ambient value setting in Radiance with an atmospheric
extinction coefficient, kappa (in 1/distance), and a scattering albedo,
Omega (unitless -- scattering coefficient over absorption plus
scattering).  The formula for radiance is then:

	L(s) = [L(0) - Omega*ambient]*exp(-kappa*s) + Omega*ambient

	where:
		L = returned distance
		s = ray travel distance

This is formula 14.6 is "Rendering with Radiance."  All values are
chromatic except distance.

-Greg

P.S.  I think I took this formula originally from Holly'course notes in
Paul Heckbert's global illumination course a few Siggraphs ago.

Thanks Greg.  We are using something similar that as
our first approximation right now.  One thing
we are trying to figure out is where the "seet-spot" is
on accuracy-- we have a very non-uniform sky luminance so
we expect the "ambient" to vary with direction.  This
grew out of us trying to make a CIE-like sky 
approximation in terms of spectral radiance (not just luminance).

It amazes me that almost nothing has been published in the graphics literature
on this....

Yeah-- we have gone over those heavily-- we used some of his
stuff to model scattering.  There seem to be two approaches:

1. Full-bore (SLOW) modeling
2. zeroth-order approximation (like the formula you sent)

We are trying to develop something in the middle-- what is unclear
is whether that would actually be an improvement over (2)-- an
empirical question I think so we have to try it.

Dear Globillumers,

RenderPark is the global illumination test-bed system we use at the
K.U.Leuven. It contains several interesting global illumination
algorithms such as bidirectional path tracing and hierarchical Monte
Carlo radiosity. Some of these algorithms have been developed in our 
research group. Others have been implemented in order to compare our own 
algorithms with. RenderPark will be especially useful if you are looking for 
a reference implementation of algorithms which you are considering to use.
It will also be very valuable if you are a rendering researcher
looking for a free, but proven, software environment to implement your
new research ideas. (Yes ... contributions are welcome!) And it is evolving
towards a useful rendering software package for others as well.

We invite you to have a look at the new release which can be obtained from 
URL:

	http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~graphics/RENDERPARK/

Some excerpts from the README file are included below.

With best regards,

Philippe Bekaert & Frank Suykens-de Laet.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is RenderPark??

RenderPark is a photo-realistic rendering tool being developed at the
Computer Graphics Research Group of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,
in Belgium. The goal is to offer a solid implementation of many existing
photo-realistic rendering algorithms in order to compare them on a fair basis,
evaluate benefits and shortcomings, find solutions for the latter and to
develop new algorithms that are more robust and efficient than the algorithms
that are available today. RenderPark will offer
you several state-of-the-art rendering algorithms that are not yet present
in other rendering packages, not even in expensive ones.
Although RenderPark is in the first place
a test-bed for rendering algorithms, it is evolving towards a full-featured 
physics-based global illumination rendering system.

The development of RenderPark started in the fall of 1993 and is supported by
the Belgian National Science Foundation (FWO-Vl), the Flemish Institute for
the Promotion of Scientific-Technological Research in Industry (IWT) and an
equipment grant by Hewlett-Packard. RenderPark is realised within the context
of various international collaboration projects as well.


Rendering algorithms implemented:

Object-space radiance algorithms:

- Galerkin radiosity (both gathering and shooting) with (or without)
  hierarchical refinement, higher order approximations, clustering,
  view-importance, ...
- Hierarchical Well Distributed Ray Set Radiosity (the most easy-to-use and 
  often also the fastest radiosity algorithm)
- (Quasi-)Monte Carlo random walk radiosity algorithms in three flavours:
  Pattanaik's particle tracing, Keller's Quasi Monte Carlo radiosity
  algorithm and Sbert's global multipath algorithm.
- stochastic ray radiosity
- density estimation (contributed by Olivier Ceulemans UCL/KUL)

Pixel-driven radiance algorithms:

- stochastic ray tracing (usable as a second pass after an object-space 
  radiance algorithm)
- bidirectional path tracing (Lafortune, Veach)


Features:

- reads models in MGF file format
- images can be saved in ppm format, for which numerous converters exist
- illuminated models after radiosity can be saved in VRML'97 format
- X-Windows/Motif based user interface
- interactive navigation using graphics hardware with support for OpenGL,
  IrisGL and starbase
- batch rendering with control through command line arguments or Inter Process 
  Communication
- rendering into an external canvas window makes RenderPark behave as a 
  "plug-in" in your applications.


Supported platforms:

- RenderPark is being developed on the following UNIX platforms:
        SGI/Iris 6.4 (GNU make and MipsPro 7.2 C/C++ compiler).
        SUN/Solaris (GNU gcc/SUN's cc + GNU make)
        Linux (GNU gcc or egcs and GNU make)

- GUI:
        X-window system + Motif toolkit

- 3D-graphics:
        OpenGL, IrisGL, starbase

RenderPark is known to compile and run fine on a couple of other (UNIX) 
platforms as well, including HP-UX, DEC Alpha, FreeBSD, ...

Hey Philippe --

This is great!  I'm glad you guys are releasing this to the world.

One question, do you intend to add TIFF i/o to your package at some point?
I'd like you to look at the high dynamic-range format I added to TIFF
recently, which is ideal for rendering and re-rendering applications.
See the web site at:

	http://www.sgi.com/Technology/pixformat/

for details.  I'd be happy to talk with you more about it if you're
interested.

Good work!
-Greg

It's something I have been thinking of already for over one year, since
you sent a mail that you were working on high-dynamic range stuff in TIFF.
I have the library here, and read the docs etc... but never arrived at
effectively implementing something due to other work.

I'll surely contact you when I start working on it!

Thanks!

Philippe.

Hi,

Fraunhofer ISE has funding for a PhD candidate to develop a
thesis on the modelling of light transport using ray tracing.
If you are a student in computer graphics or physics, 
you might want to check
        http://www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/diss1.html
for details.

I happen to need it right now, so I gave it a try. It's in the todays
RenderPark snapshot you can obtain from URL

	http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~graphics/RENDERPARK/

Implementing LogLuv TIFF support went fairly smooth. It took me in total
about 10 hours of work (including learning again how to use the TIFF lib).

You might be interested in the RenderPark/IMAGE directory. It contains
a C++ library for writing images in TIFF (both "normal" and high
dynamic range, as well as PPM format). It's pretty clean. Especially
the tiff.C file might be funny for you to see.

Checking whether RenderPark gives the same radiance values (more or less)
as radiance is soemthing I'll do next week. It probably doesn't at this time.

Write me your opinion if you find the time to give it a try.

Best regards,

Philippe.

Hi Philippe,

That's pretty quick work!  I don't know about you, but I found use of the
TIFF library to be fairly confusing with all those variables and things.
I'm impressed that you were able to get it going so quickly!

I am downloading it to take a look at your libtiff calls, but I kind of
doubt I'll manage to compile the whole thing....

Thanks!

It's surely harder than ppm or radiance pic format, but some examples help
a lot. I studied ppm2tiff and ra_tiff (Thanks for making it available!).
Writing a good TIFF reader handling all possible encodings properly
is harder than writing a TIFF writer for one specific encoding I think.

It seems to work fine on both our Octane and my Linux PC at home.

Please tell me what problems you have compiling RenderPark (with some
info about the platform you use as well if you care).
I can try to make an executable for you too if you like.

Best regards,

Philippe.

Call for Papers
33rd National Heat Transfer Conference
Hyatt Regency Hotel
Albuquerque, New Mexico
August 15-17, 1999

The ASME-Heat Transfer Division's K-20 Committee on Computational Heat
Transfer is soliciting papers for several sessions at the 1999 National
Heat Transfer Conference.  Sessions titles, pertinent topics, and
abstract submittal information are listed below.

1.  Error Estimates for Computational Heat Transfer Software.

Papers on error estimators for computational heat transfer numerical
methods are sought.  Estimators for finite difference, finite volume,
finite element and other discretization methods are of interest.  Both
methods for a priori and a posteriori error estimators are sought.  In
addition, approaches to multiple conservation laws are solicited.
Applications to heat conduction, convection and/or radiation heat
transfer are sought, as well as other computational heat transfer
analysis.

6.  Adaptive Gridding of Phase Change Problems.

Technical papers using numerical schemes with adaptive grids to solve
phase change problems are invited. In general, the numerical schemes
should be capable of tracking interface fronts along with temperature
and/or fluid flow during the phase change processes.  Problems studied
may include, but are not limited to, melting/solidification of  water,
pure metal, alloys (casting, welding), infiltration processing of metal
matrix composites, etc.

As Ian says "one which, if I read it correctly, apparently patents the
WHILE loop". That is great, if that means the REPEAT UNTIL loop remains
available to patent.

Anyone have the scoop on what this technology is:

http://www.sgi.com/newsroom/press_releases/1998/september/clearcoat.html

??

As far as I can guess it is just environment mapping with variable reflectance.
But it is hard to tell if there is more (the above release is all
marketing content-free verbiage).  I couldn't find a whitepaper at the
SGI web site either.

Thanks

Write to Brian Cabral to ask him about it.  He told me a bit, but I don't
want to give away anything he isn't ready to share, besides being afraid
I might screw up the details.  You're on track with your conclusions, I
think.  It's just a clever hack for the most part.

US Patent 5,742,292, System and Method for Realistically Displaying Images
Indicating the Effects of Lighting on an Object in Three Dimensional Space
Issue Date: April 21, 1998

and one which, if I read it correctly, apparently patents the WHILE loop
construct:

US Patent 5,561,752, Multipass Graphics Rendering Method and Apparatus with

Patents have cooties.

If you're writing and selling graphics software, talk to your attorney and
he will explain what that means and why you should not look at these
documents.  :-)

I am forwarding this message since it is clearly of interest
to all of us. The original message bounced because of the problem
I explained earlier, namely that our list server only accepts 
contributions from the listed e-mail addresses...
Again, if the adress listed in globillum is not the one you send e-mail
from, please send me the new one.

I normally refrain from commenting on the papers that I add to the RADBIB98
global illumination bibliography, but in this case I will make an exception.

Dr. Laszlo Szirmay-Kalos of the Department of Control Engineering and
Information Technology, Technical University of Budapest
(szirmay@fsz.bme.hu) and various co-authors have been prolific in the number
of high-quality papers and technical reports they have written on global
illumination over the past few years.

I have listed these publications in RADBIB98 (see below), but I want to draw
your attention to one in particular: "Stochastic Methods in Global
Illumination - State of the Art Report" (Technical Report TR-186-2-98-23).
This 29-page report (in English) presents "a state-of-the-art report of
those global illumination algorithms which involve Monte Carlo or
quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms."

If you are a grad student involved in this area, this is likely a must-read
paper. It offers an excellent overview and 84 references to follow up on.

To download this paper or the many others that Dr. Szimay-Kalos and
co-authors have written, go to http://www.fsz.bme.hu/~szirmay/puba.html.

Speaking of RADBIB98, it and GITHESIS are still very much alive.
Unfortunately, the Webmeister of their host Web site (www.ledalite.com) has
been inundated with work and has so far been unable to upload the September
30th releases for me.

RADBIB98 now has 1,440 entries (34 additions since its July 15th release)
and GITHESIS (a subset of RADBIB98 featuring MSc and PhD theses) has 168
entries (7 additions), with more to come.

I do not know when Ledalite will be able to upload the latest versions. If
it doesn't happen by the end of the month, I may set up a new Web site for
global illumination research and host them myself. In the meantime, if you
would like copies, please send me an e-mail request at iashdown@cs.ubc.ca.
(Yes, I am now a full-time computer science graduate student.)

RADBIB98 is a comprehensive bibliography of radiosity and
related global illumination papers, theses, articles, and
books. It currently includes 1,466 references -- 60 new
additions since the 98/07/15 release.

This bibliography is available in BibTex format as
RADBIB98.BIB (with a release date of November 15, 1998)
from:

  http://www.ledalite.com/library-/rrt.htm
  ftp://ftp.ledalite.com/pub/radbib98.bib

Also available from this site is an abridged version of
RADBIB98.BIB called GITHESIS.BIB. This bibliography
includes 171 references to radiosity and global illumination
theses -- 10 new additions since the 98/07/15 release.

As always, it is time-consuming and sometimes difficult to
track down conference papers and theses on radiosity and
global illumination. If you know of a relevant reference
that is not included in these bibliographies, please let us
know so that we can include it in the next release.

Dear researcher,

I've finally completed my Ph.D. duties and have placed the resulting thesis
online:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajc/Papers/thesis.ps.bz2  (2.0 MB)

While this body of work does not concentrate purely on Global
Illumination some interesting ideas are proposed, implemented and
studied that may be of interest to researchers in this field:

1. Ray space partitions for ray casting acceleration

2. Detecting total occlusion of ray shafts in non-polygonal environments

3. Constructing smooth shading functions over arbitrary topologies

4. Robust classification of shadow regions -- umbra, penumbra and full
   illumination.

Bye.
Adrian.

Interesting item from sci.optics -- anyone have any details on this
(presumably European) patent? (If the device really is patented rather than
patent pending, the details should be in the public domain.)

			   Announcement of New Journal

			   		and

                       Call for Papers for Volume 1, 1999

**************************************************************************
 

  			International Journal of
       High Performance Computer Graphics, Multimedia and Visualisation
			

			http://www.bath.ac.uk/~maxhpcg/
 
This Journal is a high quality fully refereed Journal that brings together
papers under one heading that relate to efficiency, performance or
quality in Computer Graphics, Multimedia and Visualisation. The
efficiency, performance and quality issues will include any results
that can be regarded as extending the work to a level that merits
reporting to the research and practitioner community.  

Algorithms, systems and applications are equally important, therefore
papers may be accepted that report on new algorithmic methods,
acceleration techniques, higher quality results, distributed and parallel
algorithms and systems, innovative architectures or algorithms,
progression towards or actual real-time solutions, modelling, handling
large data sets, etc.

The Journal's scope in efficiency, performance and quality issues 
include, but is not restricted to, the following topics in computer
graphics, multimedia and visualisation:

	* Algorithms - efficiency or performance issues.
	* Quality issues - accuracy and perception.
	* Tools and techniques for improving quality or efficiency.
	* Distributed and parallel algorithms or systems.
	* Fundamentals of higher performance computing.
	* Systems for high performance.
	* Architectures and technologies for high performance computing.
	* Algorithms that accelerate performance.
	* High performance or efficient applications.
	* Performance modelling, analysis and measurement.
  	* Theoretical analysis of algorithms.
	* Model building.
	* Handling large data sets.
	* Virtual environments.
	* Distributed virtual environments.
	* Augmented environments.
	* Human factors in efficient systems.
	* Real-time dynamic environments.
	* Computer animation - modelling and interaction.
	* Time varying data.
	* Volume and information visualisation.
	* Video and media processing.
	* Images and sound in multimedia.
	* Motion capture, motion control.
	* Real-time interaction.
	* High performance photo-realism in computer graphics.
	* Algorithmic impact on high performance architectures.
	* Architectural impact on high performance algorithms.
	* Industrial and commercial applications and products.
	* Future technologies - analyses and perspectives.

Other topics will be considered by the editors for publication if the work is
in keeping with the general aims and objectives of the Journal.

Format of the Journal

The initial circulation would be 4 issues per year of approximately 100 pages
per issue. The use of coloured illustrations will be encouraged where it adds
to the value of the papers. The length of papers is open, therefore each
issue is expected to contain major papers as well as work of a shorter
length.  Technical notes are encouraged with a special section being devoted
to these items. Authors can report major discoveries or innovation as a short
technical note in advance of the ideas being fully implemented. These notes
will receive very rapid refereeing in order to bring the work to the notice
of the community and also to mark the achievement of the authors.  As well as
publishing previously unseen original work, the journal provides a focus for
selected high quality conference papers that are currently  appearing in
special interest conferences related to high performance issues.  These
papers will always be re-refereed and as a result can be expected to be
extended or reworked in some way.

Full details on submission procedures for papers and other information
related to the Journal can be found at the following www site:

Hi folks,

Sorry for spamming all of you. I ran across this company, and I was
wondering if any of you know anything about it.

http://www.art-render.com

One of the founding members (CTO) is a fellow by the name of Adrian Wrigley.
His background is physics and electronic engineering, and he was a member of
the Rainbow group at Cambridge working on HDTV. It looks to be about a 20
person company.

This may be drifting off the subject, but scary-sounding implants are
getting serious attention to help replace dead photoreceptors in
the retinas of macular degeneration patients.  Take a look at:

                           '3.BMBF Project "Subretinal Microphotodiodes"

This same group has had good, working high-dynamic range camera (uses
logarithmic responding pixels, 120dB range = 1:10^6 contrast range) for
several years now that may be useful for verifying global illumination
solutions:

This is very interesting.  I would prefer this myself to a brain implant,
though I don't want the modulator to lose power before the laser, although
the following paper claims it's perfectly safe:

	Viirre, E., Johnston, R., Pryor, H. and Nagata, S. (1997).
	Laser Safety Analysis of a Retinal Scanning Display
	System. Journal of Laser Applications, 9(4), 253-260.

	(http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/r-97-31/)

I was wondering how they would manage to track eye movements, and I guess
they're still working on the problem, or at least they were still thinking
about it in 1995:

	Tidwell, M., Johnston, R.S., Melville, D. and Furness, T.A. (1995).
	The Virtual Retinal Display - A Retinal
	Scanning Imaging System. In Proceedings of Virtual Reality World '95,
	pp. 325-333.

	(http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/p-95-1/)
Quote:
	4.6.2 Exit Pupil

	The exit pupil in the current prototypes is still quite small.
	The exit pupil for Prototype #2, for example, is approximately
	1.5 millimeters. Thus, the eye must be aligned with the exit
	pupil to view the image. This will not present an issue in a
	hand held unit but is not optimal for a head mounted unit.
	Methods of enlarging the exit pupil are therefore being
	developed.

I noticed that many of their proposed applications had to do with "low vision,"
i.e., people with poor eyesight.  This also corresponds to the time when
implants start to make some kind of sense, though not to me, personally.

I haven't looked at this Web site, but you can purchase high dynamic range
cameras in the US at very reasonable prices. I don't have their catalog
handy, but I believe that the C-Cam digital cameras from The Imaging Source
(see http://www.theimagingsource.com/catalog/index.htm) cost on the order of
$500 or so.

The good news is that they have a 120 dB dynamic range; the bad news is that
they have an 8-bit output. I'll leave it as an exercise to figure out the
dynamic range of each step.

(Actually, it isn't as bad as this. You can program the camera to digitize
within a four-decade window in the dynamic range, or you can use an external
10-bit digitizer.)

The C-Cam cameras are very useful for imaging inherently high dynamic range
scenes such as bare lamps (at the expense of everything else in the field of
view, of course), but they are a looong way from offering serious
competition to our biological imaging systems.

Marc Levoy's point about saccade and blinking is interesting. Even though
I've heard before of the HIT lab device (some of the Imager people here
I think had a demo of it on the visit to Seattle a couple of years ago)
I did not think about this (serious) kind of potential problems (I'd rather
wear glasses than contacts, so you can imagine how I feel about shining
light under computer control directly on my retina).

    Hello; I chair the SIGGRAPH Seattle chapter, and hosted a talk on the
Virtual Retinal Display two years ago at the University of Washington.  I
thought I'd share some of my experiences with the VRD since it's come up
here.

    First off, a picture of the color VRD prototype (with Dr. Furness
viewing) can be found at the hit lab home page:
<http://www.hitl.washington.edu/>.  The corresponding color image is on the
CRT in the background.

    Several viewers have expressed a reticence about having a
computer-controlled laser projected directly onto your retina.  Let me
assure you, the burning sensation is minimal, and the image fades within a
week or so.

    =^)

    Truthfully, the laser (or diode) is extremely low power.  Dr. Furness
stated that leaving the beam targeted to a single region on the retina for
eight hours straight would still be well (*well*) within industry guidelines
for illumination intensity.  This is probably the most common concern (and
one of the first questions) about this device, probably because we're so
used to high-energy lasers.  In fact, the energy needed to excite our rods
or cones is extremely low.  From the rod's or cone's point of view, it
really doesn't matter if the photons are coming from a coherent beam or as
part of a larger bundle of light rays focused on the retina (say, from a CRT
light source focused via the eye's natural lens).

    Beyond that, what is particularly interesting about this device is that
the focal point of the projected image is *inside the eye's lens*.  In
normal vision, the focal point is inside the eyeball, and the entire lens is
used to focus the resulting image.  With the VRD, the light rays pivot about
the lens-centered focal point, using very little of the lens refractive
properties, and effectively bypassing the normal optical system.

    The result of this is that the image is well-focused regardless of the
viewer's optical vision, and corrective eyewear (the image above
notwithstanding) is unnecessary.  And better than that.  Dr. Furness related
a time that he was giving a demonstration and a fellow viewed the device
with one eye, and then for grins with the other eye.  In a very quiet voice
he asked what was going on, since he saw a crystal-clear image in the eye in
which he was legally blind.  Specifically, his eye was injured in an auto
accident, and corneal scarring had eventually rendered that eye useless.
Nevertheless, there was a tiny unscarred region of the cornea through which
the VRD beams could pass, and then bloom out to the full image directly on
his retina.

    What I find particularly compelling about this technology is that it
does for displays what Graffiti (and variants) did for user input.  Imagine
having an effective large high-resolution display included in your Palm
Pilot or cell-phone, for example.  =^)

    All in all, I was quite impressed with the prototypes I played with.

I checked with Warren Waggenspack, the SIGGRAPH 99 chair. He said that
there was briefly a problem, but it has been fixed. I haven't tried it so I
can't
give you a first hand report.

Since I am cluttering your mailboxes, I wanted to point out some TOG articles
you may be interested in:

Oct. 98 (this was sent out some time ago):
"Jagged Edges: When Is Filtering Necessary?"  by Avi. C. Naiman
The paper deals with edges in b/w images, however as the last
sentence of the abstract says "This work also provides a template
for how the results of psychophysical experiments can be applied in computer
graphics to address image-quality questions."

Jan 99 (should be out very soon -- we are working hard to catch up):
"Two Methods for Display of High Contrast Images", Jack Tumblin, Jessica Hodgins
and Brian Guenter

"Reflectance and Texture of Real-World Surfaces", Kristin Dana, Shree Nayar,
Bram van Ginneken, and Jan
     Koenderink

and already sent to ACM for typesetting for future issues:

"Model And Representation: The Effect of Visual Feedback on Human Performance in
a Color Picker
     Interface", Sarah Douglas and Arthur E. Kirkpatrick

" Fast and Accurate Hierarchical Radiosity Using Global Visibility", Fredo
Durand, George Drettakis, and Claude
     Puech

"Anisotropic Diffusion for Monte Carlo Noise Reduction", Michael McCool

Hi guys,

     If you're registering for SIGGRAPH online and paying via credit card, just
be careful ... I got a confirmation reply via e-mail with my credit card
unencrypted, in plain text, nicely formatted right in the middle of the
e-mail. So much for 128-bit RSA encryption, when the return path is in
plaintext.

I think calling up will be a better idea. Did anyone have a similar problem
or is it just me?

The paper

 Image-Based BRDF Acquisition Including Human Skin,
  by Steve Marschner, myself, Eric Lafortune, Ken Torrance,
   and Don Greenberg,

presented this week at the 10th Eurographics Workshop on Rendering, is
now available online at

  <http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~westin/pubs/egwr99-marschner.pdf>.

It describes how we measured the BRDF of various surfaces, including
living human skin, using only a digital camera, an electronic flash,
and a Cyberware scanner. The measurements have been verified against
measurements on our gonioreflectometer; in the best case, they appear
to be accurate to within the limits of the gonioreflectometer.

Hi all--

Unless I missed something, we didn't have a globillum BOF last year.
Shall we get together this year?  I didn't get to go to the Rendering
workshop this year, so if people would be willing to say a bit about
what they presented and/or heard about there I would really be
interested, and I am sure there are other people who wanted to go but
couldn't get to Spain. Also, from this years SIGGRAPH papers there
seems to be a lot about input data capture and perceptual mappings, are
we almost finished with figuring out how to do the calculations in
between?  How would Thursday lunch time be? I am getting to LA
Saturday, and  I could try to sign up for the time right  away.

After Ken's message I am looking forward to SIGGRAPH -- its been a
while since I have heard  things like scan-line rendering likened to
bleeding the sick.

On a more mundane topic, is anybody staying at the Hotel Figueroa, or
have you stayed there before? (just send me mail at
holly@watson.ibm.com, I doubt that everyone wants to hear about
pros/cons of SIGGRAPH hotels.)

-- Holly

Holly Rushmeier wanted to know what went on at EGWR99. Here is my trip
report, biased toward what I needed to tell LLNL and the DOE.

The purpose of the trip was to attend the 10th Eurographics Workshop on
Rendering, which took place on June 21 to 23, at the Congress Hall in
Granada, Spain. This annual workshop has become the main forum for new
research results in rendering (second only to the Siggraph conference,
which has space for only a few papers on this topic). Although it is
traditionally held in Europe, participants come from all over the world.

As in past years, many of the papers concerned local and global
illumination. For local illumination, these included papers on
mathematically modelling, measuring, representing and approximating
local reflection functions (for example, of paint, human skin, wet
materials, and surfaces covered by thin films). For global illumination
these included stochastic methods, computing soft shadows and
approximating their discontinuities, face clustering, interreflection in
thick surface geometries, accelerated matrix solution techniques, and
efficiently updating global illumination for scenes with moving objects.

A new area that is rapidly becoming important is image-based rendering,
and papers on this subject included model acquisition and display,
visibility ordering for reprojected triangles, use of images in
measuring local reflection functions, and uses of hardware in image
based rendering. My presented paper in this field "Hierarchical
Image-Based Rendering using Texture Mapping Hardware" combined my
hierarchical modelling, presented in this workshop in 1996, the
hardware-based reprojection techniques I learned from Gernot Schaufler's
talk at last year's workshop, and the hardware shading techniques I
learned from Rudiger Westermann when I visited him at Erlangen last
year. (This proves the utility of my DOE supported trip to Europe last
summer.) The paper that I was co-author on was "Shadow Penumbras for
Complex Objects by Depth Dependent Filtering of Multi-Layer Images",
presented by my Ph.D. student Brett Keating, and the shadow algorithm
described is also applicable to image-based models.

There were also talks on optimized lighting design, filtering motion
sequences using human spatio-temporal perception effects (and in related
different paper, producing motion sequences by reprojecting cached
surface points from previous frames), adding snow and trees to terrain
images, and compressing precomputed intersurface visibility data.

The vacation days in Spain were spent looking at churches and palaces,
including the Alhambra, and the vacation days in Russia were spent
touring with Slavyanka, a male slavic chorus, giving three formal
concerts, and singing informally in churches, monasteries, and at the
Hermitage museum in St. Petersburg.

There is a big issue about image quality (and not only data quantity).
For instance, there is a big deal concerning aliasing.

I don't believe ray-tracing can win soon, because of its very bad 
properties on this topic. 
Just have a look on the non-realtime side: does video-production companies
massively use raytracing ? the answer is no, and it is very far from being
( indeed, it is a minority ).

Instead, high quality renderers used in video production are using
algorithms
that are members of the projective rendering familly, with much extensions
that allows nice quality (antialiasing, reflects, shaders, procedural
textures, etc).
Typically, this is the A-buffer algorithm and various variations about it
(possibly mixed with other algorithms, at pixels needing special features).

Thus, I feel reasonable to guess than the same path can be followed
for hardware graphic accelerators:
More than one color+z per pixel, per-pixel computations, coverage masks
are features already or soon available on SGIs.
Basic limitations such as the number of textures tend to vanish on
Playstation2.
Less limitations and per-pixel shaders may help decreasing the number of
passes.
>From this, one may reach soon an A-buffer configuration, per-pixel shaders
and so on.

A-buffer allows easy anti-aliasing computation,
clear separation of geometry and shading (allowing material editing ala
IPR),
and the obstacle about turning it into hardware 10 years ago was mainly
memory...
I guess all these are properties that makes the method electable !

Eric here:
I'd like to respond by agreeing a fair bit. Beyond Blue Sky Studios (who did
win an Academy Award last year for "Bunny", http://www.blueskystudios.com/),
most production software uses A-buffers or use RenderMan, i.e.
micropolygons, with ray tracing an occasional "nothing else will do (or at
least not easily)" effect. A-buffering gives a lot of samples per pixel
cheaply, and so often looks better than adaptive subdivision ray tracing (it
catches the spokes of a wheel more consistently, for example). Is this
approach the future, or does the simplicity of ray tracing have the same
effect as the simplicity of the Z-buffer vs. the 10 hidden-surface
algorithms compared by Sutherland et al. 25 years ago? The Z-buffer won out
as of today because it had fixed memory costs, memory got cheaper, and
"dumbest wins" when programming hardware chips since it saves on dedicated
transistors. That said, Winner et al. in SIGGRAPH '97 talk about how
A-buffers can reuse much of the Z-buffer pipeline, so are low cost to add to
existing designs. Or is the future dictated more by memory size than
processor speed, i.e. A Bug's Life scenes have a gigabyte of geometry (not
including textures), and a RenderMan architecture allows dealing with it a
small chunk at a time vs. the whole caboodle at once as needed in global
solutions [but then there's Matt Pharr's ray tracing approach...]. 

BTW, to wow your friends and confound your enemies, try out some of the
real-time ray tracing demos at
http://www.acm.org/tog/resources/RTNews/demos/overview.htm That a 4K program
like chrome.zip can do anything at all I consider miraculous.

Hansong, I have a comment on Eric's comment. Pass it along to him
if you wish...

When Eric writes "...The Z-buffer won out as of today because it had
fixed memory costs, memory got cheaper, and "dumbest wins" when
programming hardware chips since it saves on dedicated transistors."
I would restate this--essentially challenging it. What wins is the nice
combination of "true" parallelism without cross-communication, or
at least with tremendously reduced cross-communication bandwidth
compared to action at the parallel stage. Machines like the SGI G, GT,
VGX, RE, and IR have this characteristic: LOW: one polygon in, HIGH
fanned-out to hundreds of non-cross-connected mini-framebuffer /
rasterization engines (multiple of these on a chip), and then LOW
fan-in to a single coherent raster-order byte stream for video display.
Such structures are well suited to the current interconnect technology.
Packaging technology reinforces this too, since the number of gates
grows much faster than the number of pins, and the frequency of
those gates grows much faster than the frequency of those pins. As
a result, the "next gen killer architecture" for the next while will be
designed as the answer to "how can I best exploit locality?" With
interesting answers like "in this core, in this cache, in this chip,
on this board, etc." This is where the "it will all be ray-tracing" line
of thinking hits the brick wall of VLSI truth. If you can think of a
structured way to ray cast, then may be it's ok. If not, then no. It's
easier to render something coherent five times than to jump around
once and I expect it to stay that way until busses become somewhat
like crossbars (i.e., multifrequency fiber with an open channel per
link-pair).

 Hello all,

 We have online the workshop programme, including 
 the abstracts for all the papers. There are two 
 mirrors, one at UC Berkeley:

      http://positron.cs.berkeley.edu/egrw99

 the other one is here in Granada (probably faster
 for europeans)

      http://alhambra.ugr.es/egrw99

 besides the programme, we have uploaded in our server
 the group photographs Robert Tobler made at Conference Hall, 
 joined by Dani Lischinski, whom also wrote the workshop report 
 (now available both at EG Web pages and here).

 In the case that any author of a paper presented in Granada
 has a Web page with more information about it, I would like to
 ask him to send me the URL (if possible) so we can point to 
 that page from the abstract page. Thank you very much in advance.

I realize that I always make the same points, but I can't help bringing this up
again.
As far as ray tracing for real time rendering, doesn't it matter what the goal
of the rendering
is?

Exploiting geometric coherence as Michael describes wins if you can settle for
a non-global lighting solution (which is the right thing to do for a lot of
applications) , or if you can cope with a temporally fixed  lighting solution
that carries around a lot of directional information. If you want to have
on-the-fly accurate
lighting, ray tracing wins I think over other schemes to make use of zbuffers
for secondary
lighting etc.

The rendering used for motion picture production is a really different problem
from
a person interacting with building design on their computer. As difficult as the
motion
picture problem is, they can define the lighting rules they want, and they don't
have to cope with changes on the fly. On the other hand, they can't allow random
artifacts to crop up -- the method they used has to be robust. On the other hand
if I were to be designing something, I want to be able to move things around
whenever I want to, and if there is an occasion glitch or aliasing it isn't
going to
bother me that much.

I had some experience with hacking on the R&H renderer some years ago.  It
was a reasonably standard scanline renderer. If I recall correctly, in the
default mode 3x3 subsampling was used for antialiasing, but by default
only one shading sample was used for each polygon that fell within a
pixel. (Though that polygon might cover a number of subsamples.) The
assumption being that typically shading varied more slowly than geometry. 
(Shading every subsample could be forced when this wasn't the case.)

I've always thought that the big win for REYES-type architectures is that
motion blur was pretty much for free. With the traditional scanline
renderers you have to render a number of slices and composite, so your
rendering cost goes up as motion blur increases. With REYES, you're just
perturbing a fixed number of fragments differently, so the cost stays
pretty much the same. 

As a trivial data point, I was running some timing tests on a new PC we
got in the graphics lab yesterday, on a 100,000 triangle whale model, in a
400x400 pixel window; definitely more than one polygon per pixel. On an
SGI O2 the update rate for hardware rendering, one light source, was 0.59s
per frame. On the new PC box, with a 450Mhz PIII, I was getting 0.50s per
frame rendered with a nested grid raytracer for the same settings. 

Of course, for animation, handling things like texture map sizzle,
shading, shadows, motion blur, and the sheer size of those scenes in a
robust manner is often more important than getting the last ounce of speed
out of your renderer.

I agree, it's poor for some cases. Near horizontal or vertical edges, for
example, will tend to have only five levels of antialiasing with a 4x4
A-buffer, i.e. edge covers nothing, edge covers 1/4th, edge covers 2/4ths,
edge covers 3/4ths, edge covers whole thing. It's pretty visible. Stochastic
sampling or other non-uniform sampling schemes are really the way to go. But
you have to walk before you run, so I suspect multisampling will (will?
already is, on high-end SGIs) be the next step. One thing that would help
multisampling further is actually doing half-decent filtering on it, not
treating a pixel like a little square. Harder in hardware, since a sample
then affects a few pixels.

Well, SIGGRAPH has asked for something of the sort, seeing as they
helped fund the workshop. So something will appear in Computer
Graphics. But not soon; it probably won't be written before
SIGGRAPH. I don't know any reason that summary shouldn't show up here
in draft form, though.

I really would like to found and buy very old Siggraph proceedings,
my favorite epoch being 1983-1989.

Siggraph and ACM have nothing that old
( I was so happy, 2 years ago, to get 
  the last 1989, with a dammaged back cover !
)
( hey, where our memory is going ? )

-> do you know any way (group, news-group, store) to get them ?
( Excepted by parsing every Library College Annual Big Sell, 
  where some very lucky people I know could find somes at 2$ each :^) 
)

Hi folks,

I enjoyed seeing, and in some cases meeting you all at SIGGRAPH. Some
interesting points of discussion came up at different times. The one that
I'm intrigued by was touched on somewhat at the BOF, but also at the
ray-tracing roundtable, and that is the role of global illumination in the
entertainment industry, or the lack thereof. I realize that this could be a
divisive topic, so I'll take the low road and be provocative.

Listening to the second (third?) annual panel on "(global illumination in
production)" echoed several sentiments I heard from people at PDI and Pixar:

	1. Global illumination is too expensive in terms of compute time,
	2. Artists can get as good or better with the tools they have, and
	3. Even if they had instant global illumination algorithms at hand, artists
don't want
	   the effect of realism. In fact, they want everything but realism.

Blue Sky engineers confirmed what I inferred from the panel, that the use of
globillum techniques, even for a lame scene in which most of the reflected
energy would bounce into space, comes up almost even with the artists
manually placing extra lights to achieve the desired results, at least in
terms of time. The artist's time costs more, though.

I'll make the additional observation that SIGGRAPH this year had a lot of
algorithms presented that were strictly approximations useful to the
entertainment industry. This is a fair deviation from past years, but I
think it reflects one of the major consumers of the technology usually
presented at SIGGRAPH.

So what this comes down to is the question, "what computational tools for
illumination would artists use, that the research community could actually
delve into?" That could perhaps be worded more precisely, but I think it
gets at the heart of the matter I'm thinking about, which is that the global
illumination community hasn't really been developing what it's primary
customer wants. If "we" were a company, we'd be going out of business.

Now I realize that there are lots of important applications of true
photorealistic image development, and physically accurate simulation.
Perhaps it is just a side effect of the glamour of the entertainment
industry overshadowing other professions, but I perceive that the bulk of
our community not in academia is in entertainment (games, movies,
television).

One suggestion that Dani mentioned was an extended "Painting with Light",
referring to the technique presented by Chris Schoeneman, et al. in 1993,
for using least squares minimization to determine the needed intensity and
color for a set of fixed position light sources. The next step in that
direction sounds intimidating, placing light sources to accomodate a desired
result. Bruce Walter et al. touched on this again in 1997 using ordinary
Phong sources to capture highlights on specular surfaces in a hardware
rendered walkthrough, again using least squares minimization. I'm sure there
are other examples, but how much harder is the real problem?

So, what thoughts does anybody have?

On another note, could somebody *please* send me the URL for the globillum
archive web page?

I just tried to print compendium.ps (with 21 single column pages of
Global Illumination formulas) that I downloaded as a file from the site
mentioned in the last broadcast. (I deleted the message and no longer
remember the author.) The %!PS-Adobe-3.0 line was preceed in the file by
3 extraneous lines, so our printer used up a ream of paper printing the
file as a text file, before a colleague here stopped it. I recommend
that you don't repeat my mistake, and delete those three lines from the
file before attempting to print it.

This question comes up on the comp.graphics newsgroups periodically.  At
some point, Stephen Spencer posted a reply to the effect that SIGGRAPH is
aware of the issue and that remedies along the lines of CD reprints are in
the works.

Matt Pharr's comment is right, the ACM is eventually going to have
everything ever published by them from 1947 on, journals & proceedings &
etc, scanned in and available in the ACM Digital Library
(http://www.acm.org/dl). From what I can tell, it's mostly just a matter of
funding and time to scan and archive all the material. Right now the Digital
Library dates back to about 1991-92 for everything, but even that's pretty
useful - there are some hard-to-get proceedings out there that have solid
information. If you use it, a nice deal at $87/year.

Other resources on the web (though not of much help for pre 1992 papers,
though...):

http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca/~ratib/code/ (go to Applications/Computer
Graphics/Publications) - a great resource, but only a few links to pre 1992
SIGGRAPH papers.

http://w3imagis.imag.fr/Membres/Fredo.Durand/Book/publi.html - Siggraph 99
and other papers on the web, links to other wonderful resources.

An actual repository exists at http://grafix3d.tzo.com/main/index.html
(click on "quick list" at the bottom of the column), but this site is
somewhat underpowered and a little clunky to access - nonetheless, it's
quite a large graphics paper repository.

In July '99, GMD founded the 'research island' "Rendering Techniques
and Application". Now, we are looking for people who want to take part
in the early phase of defining research directions and the character
of the group.

Task of the island is doing fundamental research in rendering
techniques and connected fields with focus on interactivity and on
using rendering hardware.

The size of the group is aimed at 5-7 people at the beginning of
2000. Positions offered are postdoctoral (full position), postgraduate
(half-time), students, and trainees.

For questions or more information contact me or have a look at
http://viswiz.gmd.de/reta/

Thanks, feel free to distribute this offer.

Hi-- I am teaching a seminar on BRDFs this term:
http://www2.cs.utah.edu/~shirley/classes/brdf/

If you have any other links please send them to me.

Also, I used to have a list of journals etc on my page.
If you used this they have moved to:
http://www2.cs.utah.edu/vissim/resources/

Thanks

Funny you should say that -- it's exactly what we're doing right now, with
the help of Xerox Business Services. Hopefully they'll be available by
year's end.

They'll be available through the ACM Digital Library, too, though probably 
not as quickly as they'll be available on CD.

Actually, this is quite well studied in planetary science. A model
originated by Hapke and enhanced over the last two or three decades is
generally used; it includes a term for the "opposition surge", which
is their term for retroreflection. I think there is still debate about
the actual physical mechanism involved, and how best to model it. The
enhanced Hapke model looks pretty ugly to me, but then what do I know
about planetary science?

Anyway, it's interesting to talk to these folks, as they have the
opposite problem to rendering: they know something about the radiance,
and want to deduce composition, surface structure, and even geometry
from their images. The Moon has been studied particularly well, as
it's the only extraterrestrial body from which we have actual
samples. The hope is that a model that deduces the correct
characteristics for the Moon will probably give you the right answer
on Mars or an asteroid.

I remember that a simple formula to "explain" the uniform brightness of the full
moon is that it raflects as cos(theta)^0.5, where theta of course is the angle
between surface normal and light source (sun) direction, which is the same
as the viewing direction when the moon is full. I would have to figure out
if it gives the 1/9 ratio for the half moon. I also have to find the relevant
references (Bob Woodham in our department has been involved with that very
subject in the not too distant past).

The free ray tracing bibliography has been updated, it's at
http://www.acm.org/pubs/tog/resources/bib/ While it's continuing to get hazy
as to what a ray tracing paper is (e.g. do Monte Carlo sampling papers
count? No, I try to list papers specifically about how to do ray tracing,
not about using ray tracing as a tool), I still think it's worth
maintaining.

As usual, let me know of any missing papers,

Given that the RADBIB global illumination bibliography gets over 100 hits a
month from my Web site alone, I would say that Eric's maintaining his ray
tracing bibliography is well worth the effort. If nothing else, consider the
poor grad student who has to jump from Foley et al.'s Computer Graphics to
researching a quarter-century of obscure publications. Keep up the good
work, Eric -- it is appreciated!

Hi,

	I am just catching up so sorry if this seemed old to you.  I am not a
global illum researcher per se but rather got into researching because of
the radiosity images that I have seen as well as in using a commercially
available progressive refinement program.  My comments are below.

> Listening to the second (third?) annual panel on "(global illumination in

	The third comment is true.  Most users after being exposed to a commercial
progressive refinement program says it too much work.  Too many things to
setup and it is easier to achieve by simulating radiosity using local
none-shadow casting omnidirectional lights to simulate indirect
illumination. It also requires a trememdous amount of processing power and
RAM for complex scenes.  Most people resent that fact that they have to redo
the solutions again if they want to change the geometry.  They expect the
ease of moving geometry with ttheir scanline or raytracer program, none of
them have heard about discontinuity meshing much less dynamic discontinuity
meshing.  On the other end of the spectrum, beginners using a relatively
easy program with minimal parameters are baffled by terms like
'convergeance','iterations' and 'tonemapping'.  They generally assume that
radiosity is as easy as a raytracer which only requires light placement,
color and intensity to work. They expect radiosity to have no 'user
intervention issues' at all.

	Lastly most are not aware of the quadrilateral polygonal geometry
requirement which speeds things up and avoid artifacts and they also expect
NURBS-based geometry to work well with radiosity. I think that most end
users are more likely to adapt to the monte-carlo based radiosity rather
than with the deterministic ones.	So the issue today is that radiosity even
with its gorgeous renderings are no longer persuasive once the end user
experience the amount of knowledge needed as well as the amount of
intervention needed to produce realistic renderings.  It is just so much
easier to 'fake' radiosity.  It remains to be seen if monte-carlo based
radiosity would change the tide.

=========================================================================
Dear friends,

I have two job openings in my department.

Job #1 is at the programmer level. It requires a M.Sc. or B.Sc. in
computer science, experience with graphics/geometric algorithms,
and software development. The successful candidate will help other
members of the group develop and implement new ideas, as well as
transfer our technology to other IBM divisions, such as the Internet
Division.

Job #2 is post-doctoral position. The successful candidate will interact
with other members of the group to invent and implement new
geometric/graphics algorithms/technologies.

In the Visual and Geometric Computing group, we are interested in
issues related to 3D Graphics in a networked environment, including
3D scanning, surface reconstruction, surface simplification, geometry
compression, progressive transmission, and rendering. We are also
interested in new image-based representation and rendering schemes.

The two most recent projects we have worked on are:

1) the Pieta project, where we reconstructed a 3D model of
Michaelangelo's Florentine Pieta, to support art historian
Jack Wasserman's study of the statue.

2) the Geometry Compression project, where the technology we developed
during the last four years is now part of the MPEG-4 standard.

In the 3D scanning front, and based on the experience acquired scanning
the Pieta, we are now interested in developing new inexpensive and
easy to use 3D scanning systems, including both hardware and software.

In the Geometry Compression front, we are now working closely with the
IBM Internet Media group to incorporate our MPEG-4 technology to their
HotMedia product. We are also developing new schemes/algorithms.

If any one of your students/associates is interested in any one of these
two positions, please tell her/him to get in touch with me.
IBM is an equal opportunity employer.

Best regards.

This reminds me of attitudes regarding animation techniques from about
ten or fifteen years ago.  Back then, almost everybody doing animation
was using keyframe or procedural methods, and there were only a few
academic graphics people and finite element-oriented engineers doing
dynamics, and only in specialized situations.  The realism of dynamics
was attractive, but nobody wanted to give up the control of keyframing
systems and turn animation into an initial value problem (users'
control limited to initial positions, velocities, masses, and
positions), since it would be extremely tedious to get things to move
where you wanted.

Dynamics is still not easy to use, in general, but with faster
hardware, improved algorithms, spacetime techniques, combinations of
dynamics for realism and keyframing for control, and better user
interfaces, dynamics is much more usable today than it was back then.
It's no longer just a "research topic", but is used in production on
a regular basis.

Global illumination is probably a few years behind dynamics, but it has
many of the same high level strengths and weaknesses:

    * it's good at achieving realism
    * achieving realism with "manual" techniques is tedious
    * if you use it whole hog, you give up control
    * it appears too slow
    * current methods are too specialized

If we keep chipping away at the tough research problems, pay more
attention to what users want (control, ease of use, ...) then
global illumination will become very commonly used some day soon.

Well, modeling light as waves at a macro level doesn't really make a
lot of sense: you need incredible resolution (Moravec's paper really
basically did visualization of radio wave propagation) and it's hard
to find a situation where it makes a visible difference.

More useful is modeling wave optics where it really does matter: in
interaction with surfaces and such. Several papers deal with that: the
SIGGRAPH '91 paper from He et al. comes to mind. That solved for wave
optics of a class of rough surfaces. Gondek and Meyer did simulations
of reflectance, including interference effects within the surface
microstructure; that was presented at SIGGRAPH '94, as I recall. And
it followed on a Eurographics '90 (I think) paper by Smits and
Meyer. Most recently, Jos Stam presented a paper last month at
SIGGRAPH on an anisotropic wave-optics model.

On the original point, Peter Kochevar did his dissertation here at
Cornell in 1989 on a cell-based rendering method designed for massive
parallelism. While it wasn't explicitly wave-based, it exhibited some
similar characteristics, such as diffraction around corners.

Hi all,
Does anybody know about recent activities concerning
'3D-CG and wave theory'?

It seems that actually there's not much interest in that field?!
What I only found is Moravec's paper from siggraph'81, and I am
wondering if anybody else did some work during the past two decades.

Thanks for any links, references, etc.

Maybe you are thinking of:

Gershon Elber. ``Low Cost Illumination Computation using an Approximation of
Light Wavefronts.''
                    Computer Graphics, pp 335-342, July 1994, (Siggraph 1994)
?



I think the above paper is about a geometric solution to following sets of waves
by following
a "wavefront" coming from a spherical source. It doesn't treat the wave nature
of light.

The approach described in the page Fredo cited seems to me in some ways  similar
to the Gelber
SIGGRAPH 94 paper. They are all using **geometric optics**. The geometrical
wavefront  being modelled
is the surface  that is perpendicular to the light rays passing through it.  I
think
Mitchell and Hanrahan's SIGGRAPH 92 was the first to describe these geometric
wavefronts
and their use in an illumination solution in graphics.

 Leymarie and Kimia discuss the use of BRDF's in the solution,
and BRDF's are the encapsulation of the wave effects of light near a surface
when you have
to take into account geometric features comparable in size to the wavelength of
light.
They  take an approach for tracking this waves using cellular automata -- which
sounds
very similar to Peter Kochevar's work that Steve Westin referred to. You can't
capture diffraction, interference effects with this voxel approach, unless you
have
voxels smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. For visible light, this
means
chopping up the environment pretty finely!! For other types of radiation with
substantionally
longer wavelengths this is not so bad.

Anyway,
-- computing geometric wavefronts is not the same as computing effects due to
the wave nature of
   light (i.e. diffraction, interference), but they are both interesting topics

-- for the complexity of solving for effects of the wave nature of light we are
stuck with
    dealing with discretizations on the order of (wavelength of light/ our size)
or approx.10-7,
   which makes it much more demanding computationally that some other types of
radiation.

Gulp,

I'm not very familiar with these papers on wave optics in computer
graphics, so maybe I should keep my mouth shut here, but sampling volumes
at wavelength resolution seems an especially unfortunate choice for
modeling wave propagation in the free space between objects.  

Instead, I'd suggest looking at the Fourier optics formulation for
free-space propagation of coherent and monochromatic incoherent light.  It
is a wave-optics technique that describes light as a continuous-domain
complex scalar field: each point (x,y,z) has just amplitude and phase.
The math for propagation through free space (or any ordinary uniform
medium) from a point source uses a quadratic approximation that looks
ALMOST like a Fourier transform, and has proved very accurate for lenses,
holography, diffraction and interference through arbitrary apertures, and
lots of work in optical computing (military folks used 
Fourier-optics-based equipment as much as 35-45 years ago for broadband
radio surveillance/spying).  

Would Fourier optics permit us to compute some sort of `complex form
factor' to describe the aggregate phase and amplitude relationship between
surface patches alone, so that we can forget about the empty volume
inbetween? Perhaps a complex integration across source and the
receiver patches chosen according to display image resolution? Of
course this patch-to-patch integral might be even tougher to solve than 
Shroder&Hanrahan's precise form factor integral of SIGGRAPH'93, but who
knows--it might be simpler.  Is it REALLY necessary to have wave-sized
patches, even on surfaces, if 1) their results are merged to screen
resolution for display, and 2) their free-space interactions are a
weighted sum of many sinusoids? I think only the DISTANCES between surface
points matter for the wave effects of interest to computer graphics;
there's no need to sample those distances to find the phase of a sinusoid
spanning it!

The classic text for Fourier Optics is: "Introduction to Fourier Optics"
J.W.Goodman(1968), and the library website shows 16 other promising
looking tutorials & textbooks.  It's course material in the optics track
in Electrical Engineering here at Tech, (William Rhoades taught / teaches
it and later wrote a textbook for the course I took long ago).

Shinya's pencil-tracing paper is also based on geometrical optics, described
with a somewhat different formalism.

Wavefront tracing buys you the ability to get an irradiance value along the
ray, so you can almost do backward ray tracing with interpolation instead of
density estimation.  However, because the wavefront can fold, generating
caustics, that interpolation is not simple.  There was an elegant paper from
Manchester (and I'm blanking on the reference now...) where they did
backward wavefront tracing, and used the curvature to control the kernel
size in a density estimation.

Well, it's finally happened--I've finished the dissertation, packed up my
apartment and Old Kit Bag and am leaving Georgia Tech tomorrow morning.
Monday Morning Sept. 27 I begin a 2-year post-doc fellowship with Don
Greenberg at the Program of Computer Graphics at Cornell University in
Ithaca NY.  If you need to reach me there, my address will be:

Jack Tumblin
Program of Computer Graphics
580 Rhodes Hall
Cornell University
Ithaca, NY 14853-1736

office phone: (607) 255-2067

and my e-mail at Ga Tech (ccsupjt@cc.gatech.edu) should still work until
the end of the year. I will be coming back to Atlanta in December to march
in the graduation parade (Dec 18?) so I'll see some of you then.  A
pleasant goodbye and good luck to those of you that I can't find before I
go!

Best Regards,

-Jack Tumblin (ccsupjt@cc.gatech.edu) Gradual Student, College of Computing
