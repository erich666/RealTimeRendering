What follows are corrections for the book 
 
<a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com"> 
 
<font size="+1"><i>Real-Time Rendering</i></font></a> (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions), by
<a href="http://cs.lth.se/tomas_akenine-moller">Tomas Akenine-M&ouml;ller</A>,
<a href="http://www.erichaines.com/">Eric Haines</A>,
<a href="http://renderwonk.com/">Naty Hoffman</a> (3rd and 4th),
<a href="http://c0de517e.blogspot.com">Angelo Pesce</a> (4th),
Micha&lstrok; Iwanicki (4th), and
S&eacute;bastien Hillaire (4th).

<P>
To quote <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Pillow_problems_thought_out_during_wakef/vHQ6AQAAMAAJ?q=&gbpv=1#f=false">Lewis Carroll</a>, "Other mistakes may perchance, having eluded us both, await the penetrating glance of some critical reader, to whom the joy of discovery, and the intellectual superiority which he will thus discern, in himself, to the author of this little book, will, I hope, repay to some extent the time and trouble its perusal may have cost him!"
<P>
Please do send on any corrections to us via our email addresses linked at the bottom of this page.

<h2 class="subHeader">Corrigenda for the 4th edition</h2>

<p>Significant errors:
<ul>
<li>Page 8: change "that 0 &lt; atan2(y,x) &lt; 2pi" to "that -pi &lt; atan2(y,x) &lt; pi".
<li>Page 14: change "superscalar" to "multi-core".
<li>Pages 16 through 26: change "unit cube" in numerous places, since the cube is 2x2x2, not 1x1x1. What to change it to, I'm not sure. The phrase "canonical view volume" is what this phrase stands for. Maybe "canonical cube" or we could dub it the "standard cube."(This error has been in all four editions, and is one that early versions of the OpenGL Red Book also makes.)*
<li>Page 67: There is a sign error in the view vector, which causes a number of rewrites. Change "(c-l) / || c-l ||" to "(l-c) / || l-c ||". Change "r = -(v x u') / || v x u' ||" to "r = (v x u') / || v x u' ||", i.e., remove the minus sign. Change "u = v x r" to "u = r x v". Change "and $\mb v$ with $(0,0,1)$" to "and $\mb v$ with $(0,0,-1)$". In the left matrix that follows, change "v_x & v_y & v_z & 0" to "-v_x & -v_y & -v_z & 0". In the right matrix, change "v_x & v_y & v_z & -\mb t\cdot\mb v" to "-v_x & -v_y & -v_z & \mb t\cdot\mb v".\
<li>Page 136: Five lines from the bottom, "the width of the low-pass filter is increased" to "the sampling rate of the low pass filter is decreased". Similarly, four lines from the bottom, "As shown in the figure, the filter width... original sampling rate." should simply read "As shown in the figure, the resampling rate is set to half the original sampling rate."
<li>Page 137: Figure 5.23, change the "On the right,..." sentence to, "On the right, the sampling rate is halved and the sinc filter is scaled horizontally by a factor of two."
<li>Page 153: Equation 5.26, the resulting color c_0 should be divided by a_0 to compensate for the alpha coverage. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing#Description">this page</a>.
<li>Page 204: "one can show that 1.5 texels out of 4 will survive" - this should be "... 2 texels out of 4 ...".
<li>Page 214: Equation 6.16, the second component of the normal should be "h_y", not "h_x".
<li>Page 242: "by slicing it parallel to the view direction" to "by slicing it perpendicular to the view direction".
<li>Page 251: Equation 7.6, the denominator "d_r" should be "d_o".
<li>Page 256: "Called an exponential shadow map (ESM) or exponential variance shadow map (EVSM)" - remove "or exponential variance shadow map (EVSM)".
<li>Page 256: "compares this new approach with ESM", change to "compares this new approach with another method, the exponential variance shadow map (EVSM)".
<li>Page 381: In the footnote, remove the parenthetical "(where the distance is taken from the light surface, not its center)" after "Note that while, for spherical lights, the falloff does take the usual inverse square distance formulation". The distance to the center is used to compute the lighting for a sphere. For derivations, see <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=AFCCEEBE85D2637946EFFFA5C7F4A5E6?doi=10.1.1.31.3313&rep=rep1&type=pdf">this technical report</a>, "Area Light Sources for Real-Time Graphics" by John M. Snyder.
<li>Page 407: before Equation 10.30, change "longitude, varies from 0 to 2pi radians" to "longitude, varies from -pi to pi radians".
<li>Page 429: "Figure 10.43 shows how an irradiance map -derived directly compares to one synthesized by the nine-term function." to "See Figure 10.45 for a comparison of an irradiance map derived by integration with one expressed by a nine-term spherical harmonic function."
<li>Page 476: "Hu [780] describes how this data can be compressed further." [780] is the wrong reference, this sentence should reference "Lightmap Compression in Halo 3", Yaohua Hu, GDC 2008 (which is missing from the book's bibliography). Slides <a href="https://slideplayer.com/slide/14123046/">here</a>.
<li>Page 592: Figure 14.3, "an opaque surface S is shown in orange" should be "... in purple."
<li>Page 727: "the right tangent at the join has to be twice as long as the left tangent." to "the right difference vector between the control points at the join has to be twice as long as the left difference vector between the control points."
<li>Page 733: "square function" to "box function".
<li>Page 733: "is created by integrating $\beta_0(t)$" to "is created by convolving $\beta_0(t)$ with $\beta_0(t)$", and "is created by integrating $\beta_1(t)$" to "is created by convolving $\beta_1(t)$ with $\beta_0(t)$".
<li>Page 751: Equation 17.56, the expression should be divided by "2 \epsilon".
<li>Page 752: Equation 17.57, the last part on the second line should change sign to be negative, i.e., "- r_b h (1 - h)".
<li>Page 767 and 777: "The normal is then found as the cross product between those vectors." to "... between these." (tangent patches)
<li>Page 834: change "&lt;" to "&gt;" on the right side of Equations 19.2 and 19.3.
<li>Page 862: change "(<b>v</b>-<b>c</b>)" to "(<b>c</b>-<b>v</b>)" in Equation 19.6 and four lines up from it in the text.
<li>Page 1092: Reference 793, these course notes are no longer online, so this reference should be replaced by reference 903, Kirk, David, and Wen-Mei Hwu, <I>Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach</I>, Morgan-Kaufmann, 2016 <br><a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=wcS_DAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=%22Programming+Massively+Parallel+Processors%22&ots=Hk9StFFM-x&sig=eFl3IKb4SDCmmvm7TGO7F_sQ8l0#v=onepage&q&f=false">(see Google Book excerpt here)</a>.
<li>Page 1133: Reference 1580, the author of these slides should be Eitan Grinspun; Peter Schr&ouml;der ran the course. (Not fixed in any printing, as the reference order then needs to be changed.)*
</ul>

<p>Minor errors:
<ul>
<li>Page 21: The end of sentence "where $d$ is the discrete (integer) index of the pixel and $c$ is the
continuous (floating point) value within the pixel" should have the reference "~\cite{Heckbert90a}." - this is reference #692, "What Are the Coordinates of a Pixel?"
<li>Page 22: in Figure 2.8 it says "pixel processing and merging" in the caption, but should say "pixel shading and merging" in order to match the functional stage name.
<li>Page 25: "except for application of the texture, which occurs in the rasterization stage" should say "... in the pixel processing stage".
<li>Page 72: "we have a gimbal lock (Section 4.2.2)," - self-reference; remove entire phrase.
<li>Page 77: "from the multiplication seen in Equation 4.3.1" should be "... Equation 4.32".
<li>Page 100: "and the constants d and f" to "and the constants d and e", with "e" being derived from n and f, as shown further on.

<li>Page 265: "We have avoiding" to "We have avoided".
<li>Page 239: "depth layer between the occlude and receiver" - missing letter, change to "occluder".
<li>Page 247: "function of what proportion of the light's area" - change "proportion" to "portion".
<li>Page 333: "is the {\em distribution of visible normals}" to "is related to the {\em distribution of visible normals}".
<li>Page 351: "Equations 9.62 and 9.63 result in a uniform distribution of" to "Equation 9.62 results in a uniform distribution of".
<li>Page 494: "diffuse and reflective surfaces" - "reflective" to "specular".
<li>Page 615: "used to stored" - should be "store".
<li>Page 616: "simulated using participating media" to "represented as participating media".
<li>Page 727: Figure 17.10, change the "where q^3 = r^0" superscripts change to subscripts, "where q_3 = r_0", matching the figure itself.
<li>Page 737: "As can be seen in the bottom row in Equation 17.33" to "As can be seen in the rightmost part of Equation 17.33".
<li>Page 785: RenderDoc, "Windows debugger" to "Windows, Linux, and Android debugger".
<li>Page 819: "Construction time of a spatial data structure can be expensive" to "... can be long".
<li>Page 820: "children nodes" to "child nodes".
<li>Page 823: "or games like DOOM (2016), back when there was no hardware z-buffer" - remove "(2016)" ;-)
<li>Page 830: "not considered to contribute" to "considered to not contribute".
<li>Page 910: "Clarberg et al. [271] present hardware extensions..." The rest of this paragraph should follow the next paragraph, "Andersson et al.", (as a separate paragraph), instead of preceding it.
<li>Page 943: First paragraph in 22.2 - "the red with 40/255" to "the blue with 40/255".
<li>Page 968: Figure 22.16, "Three points being tested" to "Four points being tested".
<li>Page 970: nine lines down, "curves!B&eacute;zier" should not be visible; it was a poorly-formatted index entry.

<li>Page 999: Figure 23.5, replace angle "a" with "\alpha", to match the text that follows.
<li>Page 1036: Change "The task of the GPC is" to "The task of the GCP (Graphics Command Processor) is" and change "The GPC, ACES" to "The GCP, ACES". Note that AMD does not refer to the Graphics Command Processor in abbreviated form; this is our own abbreviation.
<li>Page 1054: Reference 68, a new edition of this book has appeared, and the chapter is now Chapter 35. The editors and full title are:
    Dinesh P. Mehta and Sartaj Sahni, eds., <i>Handbook of Data Structures and Applications</i>, Second Edition, Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, 2018.

</ul>

<p>Very minor errors (small readability errors, probably not worth your time correcting in your own copy):
<ul>
<li>Page xiv: the phrase "who helped us along the way" is repeated; replace the second instance with "involved", i.e. "about everyone involved". Michael Drobot is thanked twice, and Wolfgang Engel's name was slightly out of order.

<p> Errors followed by a "*" have not been fixed internally yet and are likely to be deferred until a future fifth edition (no, none is planned right now), as they could affect pagination. Otherwise, fixes are in place in online materials (e.g., references and figures) and will be in future printings, as possible.

The second edition, 2nd print is recognized, for example, by that Steve Morein and
David Wu are included in the acknowledgments on page xiii. Also, if you have the 1st print,
you need to look at both the list for the 1st print and for the 2nd.

One way to identify the second printing: go to the first
page of the Preface; if the web site listed near the bottom of the page is
"http://www.realtimerendering.com," then this copy is from the second printing.
