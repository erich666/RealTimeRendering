What follows are corrections for the book 
 
<a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com"> 
 
<font size="+1"><i>Real-Time Rendering</i></font></a> (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions), by
<a href="http://cs.lth.se/tomas_akenine-moller">Tomas Akenine-M&ouml;ller</A>,
<a href="http://www.erichaines.com/">Eric Haines</A>,
<a href="http://renderwonk.com/">Naty Hoffman</a> (3rd and 4th),
<a href="http://c0de517e.blogspot.com">Angelo Pesce</a> (4th),
Micha&lstrok; Iwanicki (4th), and
S&eacute;bastien Hillaire (4th).

<h2 class="subHeader">Corrigenda for the 4th edition</h2>

<p>Significant errors:
<ul>
<li>Page 14: change "superscalar" to "multi-core".
<li>Pages 16 through 26: change "unit cube" in numerous places, since the cube is 2x2x2, not 1x1x1. What to change it to, I'm not sure. The phrase "canonical view volume" is what this phrase stands for. Maybe "canonical cube" or we could dub it the "standard cube."(This error has been in all four editions, and is one that early versions of the OpenGL Red Book also makes.)*
<li>Page 67: There is a sign error in the view vector. Change "and $\mb v$ with $(0,0,1)$" to "and $\mb v$ with $(0,0,-1)$". In the left matrix that follows, change "v_x & v_y & v_z & 0" to "-v_x & -v_y & -v_z & 0". In the right matrix, change "v_x & v_y & v_z & -\mb t\cdot\mb v" to "-v_x & -v_y & -v_z & \mb t\cdot\mb v".\
<li>Page 214: Equation 6.16, the second component of the normal should be "h_y", not "h_x".
<li>Page 242: "by slicing it parallel to the view direction" to "by slicing it perpendicular to the view direction".
<li>Page 256: "Called an exponential shadow map (ESM) or exponential variance shadow map (EVSM)" - remove "or exponential variance shadow map (EVSM)".
<li>Page 256: "compares this new approach with ESM", change to "compares this new approach with another method, the exponential variance shadow map (EVSM)".
<li>Page 381: In the footnote, remove the parenthetical "(where the distance is taken from the light surface, not its center)" after "Note that while, for spherical lights, the falloff does take the usual inverse square distance formulation". The distance to the center is used to compute the lighting for a sphere. For derivations, see <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=AFCCEEBE85D2637946EFFFA5C7F4A5E6?doi=10.1.1.31.3313&rep=rep1&type=pdf">this technical report</a>, "Area Light Sources for Real-Time Graphics" by John M. Snyder.
<li>Page 429: "Figure 10.43 shows how an irradiance map -derived directly compares to one synthesized by the nine-term function." to "See Figure 10.45 for a comparison of an irradiance map derived by integration with one expressed by a nine-term spherical harmonic function."
<li>Page 727: "the right tangent at the join has to be twice as long as the left tangent." to "the right difference vector between the control points at the join has to be twice as long as the left difference vector between the control points."
<li>Page 733: "square function" to "box function".
<li>Page 733: "is created by integrating $\beta_0(t)$" to "is created by convolving $\beta_0(t)$ with $\beta_0(t)$", and "is created by integrating $\beta_1(t)$" to "is created by convolving $\beta_1(t)$ with $\beta_0(t)$".
<li>Page 751: Equation 17.56, the expression should be divided by "2 \epsilon".
<li>Page 767 and 777: "The normal is then found as the cross product between those vectors." to "... between these." (tangent patches)
<li>Page 1092: Reference 793, these course notes are no longer online, so this reference should be replaced by reference 903, Kirk, David, and Wen-Mei Hwu, <I>Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach</I>, Morgan-Kaufmann, 2016 <br><a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=wcS_DAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=%22Programming+Massively+Parallel+Processors%22&ots=Hk9StFFM-x&sig=eFl3IKb4SDCmmvm7TGO7F_sQ8l0#v=onepage&q&f=false">(see Google Book excerpt here)</a>.
<li>Page 1133: Reference 1580, the author of these slides should be Eitan Grinspun; Peter Schr&ouml;der ran the course. (Not fixed in any printing, as the reference order then needs to be changed.)*
</ul>

<p>Minor errors:
<ul>
<li>Page 21: The end of sentence "where $d$ is the discrete (integer) index of the pixel and $c$ is the
continuous (floating point) value within the pixel" should have the reference "~\cite{Heckbert90a}." - this is reference #692, "What Are the Coordinates of a Pixel?"
<li>Page 22: in Figure 2.8 it says "pixel processing and merging" in the caption, but should say "pixel shading and merging" in order to match the functional stage name.
<li>Page 72: "we have a gimbal lock (Section 4.2.2)," - self-reference; remove entire phrase.
<li>Page 128: "likely to have lower register occupancy" to "likely to have lower register usage".
<li>Page 131: "goal of this sampling process is" - unexpected line break.
<li>Page 145: "Interleaved samplingindexsampling!interleaved" - typographical error.
<li>Page 160: "multiplied by the stored alpha before being display" - should be "displayed".
<li>Page 265: "We have avoiding" to "We have avoided".
<li>Page 239: "depth layer between the occlude and receiver" - missing letter, change to "occluder".
<li>Page 247: "function of what proportion of the light's area" - change "proportion" to "portion".
<li>Page 333: "is the {\em distribution of visible normals}" to "is related to the {\em distribution of visible normals}".
<li>Page 351: "Equations 9.62 and 9.63 result in a uniform distribution of" to "Equation 9.62 results in a uniform distribution of".
<li>Page 494: "diffuse and reflective surfaces" - "reflective" to "specular".
<li>Page 615: "used to stored" - should be "store".
<li>Page 616: "simulated using participating media" to "represented as participating media".
<li>Page 785: RenderDoc, "Windows debugger" to "Windows, Linux, and Android debugger".
<li>Page 819: "Construction time of a spatial data structure can be expensive" to "... can be long".
<li>Page 820: "children nodes" to "child nodes".
<li>Page 823: "or games like DOOM (2016), back when there was no hardware z-buffer" - remove "(2016)" ;-)
<li>Page 830: "not considered to contribute" to "considered to not contribute".
<li>Page 910: "Clarberg et al. [271] present hardware extensions..." The rest of this paragraph should follow the next paragraph, "Andersson et al.", (as a separate paragraph), instead of preceding it.
<li>Page 970: nine lines down, "curves!B&eacute;zier" should not be visible; it was a poorly-formatted index entry.
<li>Page 999: Figure 23.5 - replace angle "a" with "\alpha", to match the text that follows.
<li>Page 1054: Reference 68, a new edition of this book has appeared, and the chapter is now Chapter 35. The editors and full title are:
    Dinesh P. Mehta and Sartaj Sahni, eds., <i>Handbook of Data Structures and Applications</i>, Second Edition, Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, 2018.
<li>Page 1061: Reference 199, "The Art and Science of Digital Compositing" is now in a second edition, 2008.

      Practical Guide," is now in its Fifth Edition, Morgan-Kaufmann, 2002.
<li>Page 1074: Reference 461, "Practical Linear Algebra: A Geometry Toolbox," is now in its Third Edition, A K Peters/CRC Press, 2013.
<li>Page 1098: Reference 910, all the text for this reference after "Cited on p. 979" should be deleted.
<li>Page 1100: Reference 941, the second author's last name should be "Akenine-M&ouml;ller" (oh, the irony).
<li>Pages 1100-1101: References 952 and 957-961, The second author's first name should be "S\'{e}bastien" not "tian".
<li>Page 1112: Reference 1172, the "Computer Graphics Archive" has moved to <a href="http://casual-effects.com/data">http://casual-effects.com/data</a>.
<li>Page 1117: Reference 1259, the book is "GPU Pro 7" (not "5"), 2016, and the page numbers should be 219--229, not 219--230. Also, very minor error, the title "Real-Time BC6H Compression on GPU" should be in quotes, not italicized.
<li>Page 1122: Reference 1358, the first author's first name should be "Anjul" not "Anuj".
<li>Page 1133: Reference 1575, the last author's last name should be "Froehlich" not "Fro".
<li>Page 1144: Reference 1787, the first author's last name should be "Tropp" not "Trop".
<li>Page 1146: Reference 1829, change "Johnsson" to "Johnson".
</ul>

<p>Very minor errors (only the authors should care, for future revisions):
<ul>
<li>Page xiv: the phrase "who helped us along the way" is repeated; replace the second instance with "involved", i.e. "about everyone involved". Michael Drobot is thanked twice, and Wolfgang Engel's name was slightly out of order.
<li>Page 3: "And after" to simply "After".
<li>Page 18: "These are in fact homogeneous coordinates" to the stronger "These are homogeneous coordinates".
<li>Page 31: "execution by some number GPU shader cores" to "... some number of GPU...".
<li>Page 94: Figure 4.18, the "z" axis labels should all be italicized, "<i>z</i>".

<li>Page 140 (3rd printing): Figure 5.24, "per pixel, and as can be seen, two of" to "per pixel. Two of".
<li>Page 237: Figure 7.12 could include a reference to Christoph Peters' page <a href="http://momentsingraphics.de/?p=175">http://momentsingraphics.de/?p=175</a>.*
<li>Page 397: "(see [1838]):" should be "[1838]:", as we never consider a citation something we point at.
<li>Page 485: "an unique" to "a unique".
<li>Page 473: Figure 11.21's hemisphere is squashed, it should be truly a round hemisphere.*
<li>Page 505: Figure 11.39, extend the black ground plane line to the right so it perfectly matches the blue rectangle below.
<li>Page 616: "featuring high-scattering coefficients" - remove hyphen.
<li>Page 626: Figure 14.35, image should be centered (missing "\centerline").
<li>Page 658: Figure 15.8, the two triangles should be aligned horizontally.
<li>Page 704: Figure 16.15, the line of text beginning "The triangles could" should be shifted to the left, to match the left margin of the other lines of text.
<li>Page 749: Figure 17.32 could include a reference to Tamy Boubekeur's page <a href="https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/boubek/tessellation/">https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/boubek/tessellation/</a>.*
<li>Page 756 (3rd printing): Figure 17.38, "As can be seen, the" to "The".
<li>Page 767: "over the surface The same" - add a period after "surface".
<li>Page 767 and 777: "The normal is then found as the cross product..." - these next few sentences are identical between these pages. The later one should be revised. Not touched for pagination reasons.*
<li>Page 772 (3rd printing): Figure 17.58, "As can be seen in" to "As seen in".
<li>Page 783 (3rd printing): Figure 17.70, "As can be seen, there" to "There".

<li>Page 843: Figure 19.21 could probably just be pseudocode in the text instead of a figure, as done in the Intersection Test Methods chapter, for example.*
<li>Page 844 (3rd printing): Figure 19.20, replace "As can be seen, the" to simple "The".
<li>Page 865: "time-critical rendering.." - remove a period.

<li>Page 931: "Our eyes have a field of view for binocular vision (where both eyes can see the same object) of
114 horizontal degrees." to "Our eyes have a horizontal field of view for binocular vision (where both eyes can see the same object) of 114 degrees."

</ul>

<p> Errors followed by a "*" have not been fixed internally yet and are likely to be deferred until a future fifth edition (no, none is planned right now), as they could affect pagination. Otherwise, fixes are in place in online materials (e.g., references and figures) and will be in future printings, as possible.

The second edition, 2nd print is recognized, for example, by that Steve Morein and
David Wu are included in the acknowledgments on page xiii. Also, if you have the 1st print,
you need to look at both the list for the 1st print and for the 2nd.

One way to identify the second printing: go to the first
page of the Preface; if the web site listed near the bottom of the page is
"http://www.realtimerendering.com," then this copy is from the second printing.
